## Setting up the development environment

1. Install Golang environment (check instructions on the official page https://go.dev/doc/install depending on your OS). Go 1.26.3+ is required — see `go.mod` for the exact version.
2. Fork this repo and clone it. Base your changes on the [dev](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/tree/dev) branch as it contains the latest unreleased changes.
3. Run `make dev-setup` in the main directory of the cloned repository.
4. You can clean up the dev setup by running `make dev-cleanup`.

> **Danger:** `make sweep` destroys the entire Snowflake test infrastructure — use only on dedicated development accounts.

## Repository structure

The notable technical files/directories inside the repository:

- `Makefile` - contains instructions to set up the developer's environment, run tests, etc.
- `pkg/provider` - definition of the provider
- `pkg/resources`, `pkg/datasources` - definitions and tests (consult section [Running the tests locally](#running-the-tests-locally) below) for resources and datasources
- `pkg/acceptance` - helpers for acceptance and integration tests
- `pkg/sdk` - definitions of the SDK objects (SDK is our client to Snowflake, using [gosnowflake driver](https://github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake) underneath)
- `pkg/sdk/testint` - integration tests for the SDK (consult section [Running the tests locally](#running-the-tests-locally) below)

**⚠️ Important ⚠️** We are in progress of cleaning up the repository structure, so beware of the changes in the packages/directories.

## Code Generation

Much of the codebase is produced by a custom generation framework. Before making changes that touch generated files, read the [Running Generators](pkg/internal/genhelpers/README.md#running-generators) section of the genhelpers README. It covers which files are generated (never edit `*_gen.go`), which `make` targets regenerate which outputs, when to regenerate after a change, CLI filtering flags, and troubleshooting.

## Running the tests locally

Currently, we have three main types of tests:
- SDK unit tests (in directory `pkg/sdk`, files ending with `_test.go`)
- SDK integration tests (in directory `pkg/sdk/testint`, files ending with `_integration_test.go`)
- resource/datasource acceptance tests (in directories `pkg/resources` and `pkg/datasources`, files ending with `_acceptance_test.go`)

Both integration and acceptance tests require the connection to Snowflake (some of the tests require multiple accounts).

The preferred way of running particular tests locally is to create a config file `~/.snowflake/config`, with the following content.

```toml
[default]
account_name = "<your account name>"
organization_name = "<organization in which your account is located>"
user = "<your user>"
password = "<your password>"
role = "<your role>"
host="<host of your account, e.g. organisation-account_name.snowflakecomputing.com>"
```

To be able to run all the tests you additionally need the second profile `[secondary_test_account]`:

```toml
[secondary_test_account]
account_name = "<your account name>"
organization_name = "<organization in which your account is located>"
user = "<your user on the secondary account>"
password = "<your password on the secondary account>"
role = "<your role on the secondary account>"
host="<host of your account, e.g. organisation-account_name2.snowflakecomputing.com>"
```

Some tests also require an Azure account profile `[azure_test_account]`. This is only used in non-prod environments for tests that require multiple Snowflake instances on different cloud providers (e.g. cross-cloud connection failover tests):

```toml
[azure_test_account]
account_name = "<your Azure account name>"
organization_name = "<organization in which your Azure account is located>"
user = "<your user on the Azure account>"
password = "<your password on the Azure account>"
role = "<your role on the Azure account>"
host="<host of your Azure account, e.g. organisation-azure_account_name.snowflakecomputing.com>"
```

Some tests also require a Snowflake defaults account profile `[snowflake_defaults_test_account]`. This is only used in non-prod environments for tests that check for Snowflake default behavior (e.g. having the built-in account authentication policy on account when no user-defined policy is attached):

```toml
[snowflake_defaults_test_account]
account_name = "<your Snowflake defaults account name>"
organization_name = "<organization in which your Snowflake defaults account is located>"
user = "<your user on the Snowflake defaults account>"
password = "<your password on the Snowflake defaults account>"
role = "<your role on the Snowflake defaults account>"
host="<host of your Snowflake defaults account, e.g. organisation-defaults_account_name.snowflakecomputing.com>"
```

**TIP**: check [how-can-i-get-my-organization-name](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/guides/authentication_methods#how-can-i-get-my-organization-name) and [how-can-i-get-my-account-name](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/guides/authentication_methods#how-can-i-get-my-account-name) sections in our guides if you have troubles setting the proper `organization_name` and `account_name`.

We are aware that not everyone has access to two different accounts, so the majority of tests can be run using just one account. The tests setup however, requires both profiles (`default` and `secondary_test_account`) to be present. You can use the same details for `secondary_test_account` as in the `default` one, if you don't plan to run tests requiring multiple accounts. The warning will be logged when setting up tests with just a single account.

There is also environment flag `TEST_SF_TF_SIMPLIFIED_INTEGRATION_TESTS_SETUP` available to set up only the default account for the integration tests. Careful, as tests requiring multiple accounts will fail when using this flag.

**⚠️ Important ⚠️** Some of the tests require the privileged role (like `ACCOUNTADMIN`). Otherwise, the managed objects may not be created. If you want to use lower role, you have to make sure it has all the necessary privileges added.

**When to run which:**
- **Integration tests** — when directly working with a Snowflake object in the SDK
- **Acceptance tests** — when modifying the underlying SDK object or creating/modifying a resource/data source

To run the tests we have the following commands:
- `make test-unit` run unit tests
- `make test-acceptance` run acceptance tests (without account-level ones)
- `make test-integration` run integration tests (without account-level ones)
- `make test-account-level-features` run both integration and acceptance tests verifying account-level features
- `make test-functional` run functional tests of the underlying terraform libraries (currently SDKv2)

**Run a single test:**
```bash
# Run tests for a single resource (PascalCase resource name)
make test-acceptance-Warehouse   # runs all TestAcc_Warehouse* tests

# Run a single acceptance test
TF_ACC=1 TEST_SF_TF_REQUIRE_TEST_OBJECT_SUFFIX=1 TEST_SF_TF_REQUIRE_GENERATED_RANDOM_VALUE=1 \
  SF_TF_ACC_TEST_ENABLE_ALL_PREVIEW_FEATURES=true \
  go test --tags=non_account_level_tests -run "^TestAcc_SpecificTestName$" -v -timeout=20m ./pkg/testacc

# Run a single integration test
TEST_SF_TF_REQUIRE_TEST_OBJECT_SUFFIX=1 TEST_SF_TF_REQUIRE_GENERATED_RANDOM_VALUE=1 \
  go test --tags=non_account_level_tests -run "^TestInt_SpecificTestName$" -v -timeout=60m ./pkg/sdk/testint

# Find test names
grep -r "func TestAcc_" ./pkg/testacc | grep -i <keyword>
grep -r "func TestInt_" ./pkg/sdk/testint | grep -i <keyword>
```

The tests distinction between account-level and non-account-level tests is currently achieved by go build directive:
- `//go:build account_level_tests` — tests that modify account-level settings; must not be run in parallel (use `-p=1`)
- `//go:build non_account_level_tests` — tests which do not modify account-level settings; safe to run concurrently on the same account
Make sure you specify the correct directive when adding new integration or acceptance test file.

You can run the particular tests from inside your chosen IDE but remember that you have to set `TF_ACC=1` environment variable to run any acceptance tests (the above commands set it for you). There are more environment variables set in the above Makefile rules, so familiarize with them before using them. It is also worth setting up more verbose logging (check [this section](FAQ.md#how-can-i-turn-on-logs) for more details).

## Making a contribution

### Discuss a change with us!
It's important to establish the scope of the change before the actual implementation. We want to avoid the situations in which the PR is rejected because it contradicts some other change we are introducing.

Remember to consult [our roadmap](ROADMAP.md), maybe we are already working on the issue!

It's best to approach us through the GitHub issues: either by commenting the already existing one or by creating a new one.

### Follow the code conventions inside the repository
We believe that code following the same conventions is easier to maintain and extend. When working on the given part of the provider try to follow the local solutions and not introduce too many new ideas.

Parts of the codebase are auto-generated (`*_gen.go` files). **Never edit these files directly.** Instead, edit the definition files (`pkg/sdk/generator/defs/*_def.go`) or the `*_ext.go` extension files that sit alongside the generated code. `make pre-push` runs all generators.

### Test the change
Every introduced change should be tested. Depending on the type of the change it may require (any or mix of):
- adding/modifying existing unit tests (e.g. changing the behavior of validation in the SDK)
- adding/modifying existing integration tests (e.g. adding missing SDK invocations)
- adding/modifying existing acceptance tests (e.g. fixing the parameter on the resource level)

When writing acceptance tests, use the configuration and assertion generators instead of manually writing config strings. See [this guide](./pkg/acceptance/bettertestspoc/README.md) for more details.

It's best to discuss with us what checks we expect prior to making the change.

### Describe the breaking changes

If the change requires manual actions when bumping the provider version, they should be added to the [migration guide](MIGRATION_GUIDE.md).

### Hide the changes behind the feature switch (if applies)

When modifying the stable parts of the provider, we need to be careful with introducing the breaking changes (we follow semantic versioning, so we shouldn't introduce breaking changes without bumping the major version number, except preview features and Snowflake BCR Bundles - [docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/terraform#versioning-and-preview-features)).

Instead of bumping the version, we can hide the behavior change behind the experiment, that way:
- We limit the number of major version releases.
- We allow accessing the newest features as early as possible.
- We do not break existing configurations with the additional features.

All current experiments are available in the [dedicated section in the registry documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs#active-experiments).

To add the experiment:
- Add it to [`allExperiments`](pkg/provider/experimentalfeatures/experimental_features.go).
- Guard the logic with conditional statement like (example in the [user resource](pkg/resources/user.go)):
```go
if experimentalfeatures.IsExperimentEnabled(experimentalfeatures.UserEnableDefaultWorkloadIdentity, providerCtx.EnabledExperiments) {
  // new logic here
} else {
  // old logic here
}
```
- Remember to generate the docs [before submitting the PR](#before-submitting-the-pr); the new experiment will be added to the docs automatically.
- Add entry to the [migration guide](MIGRATION_GUIDE.md).
- For acceptance tests:
  - Use the separate file (e.g., `data_source_users_experimental_features_acceptance_test.go` instead of `data_source_users_acceptance_test.go`).
  - Use the secondary profile with the experiment enablement (e.g., `providerModelWithExperimentEnabled := providermodel.SnowflakeProvider().WithProfile(testprofiles.Secondary).WithExperimentalFeaturesEnabled(experimentalfeatures.ParametersReducedOutput)`)
  - Use a separate provider factory for the steps with the experiment enabled (e.g., `providerFactoryUsingCache("TestAcc_Experimental_Users_ParametersReducedOutput")`).

### Before submitting the PR

The documentation for the provider is generated automatically. We follow the few formatting conventions that are automatically checked with every PR. They can fail and delay the resolution of your PR. To make it much less possible, run `make pre-push` before pushing your changes to GH. It will reformat your code (or suggest reformatting), generate all the missing docs, clean the dependencies, etc. To verify the same checks *without* modifying files, use `make pre-push-check` (generated files are removed after) — useful for a dry-run before opening a PR.

### Naming and describing the PR

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit message formatting and PR titles. Please try to adhere to the standard.

PR titles must match the pattern:
```
(chore|feat|fix|docs)(\(scope\))?(!)?: description
```

Refer to the [regular expression](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/.github/workflows/title-lint.yml#L17) for the full PR title validation regex.

Implemented changes should be described thoroughly (we will prepare PR template for the known use cases soon):
- reference the issue that is addressed with the given change
- summary of changes
- summary of added tests
- (optional) what parts will be covered in the subsequent PRs

### Requesting the review

We check for the new PRs in our repository every day Monday-Friday. We usually need 1-2 days to leave the review comments. However, there are times when you can expect even more than a week response time. In such cases, please be patient, and ping us after a week if we do not post a reason for the delay ourselves. It's possible that we just missed it.

During our review we try to point out the unhandled special cases, missing tests, and deviations from the established conventions. Remember, review comment is like an invitation to dance: you don't have to agree but please provide the substantive reasons.

Please do not resolve our comments. We prefer to resolve ourselves after the comments are followed up by the contributor.

**⚠️ Important ⚠️** Tests and checks are not run automatically after your PR. We run them manually, when we are happy with the state of the change (even if some corrections are still necessary).

### Adding Support for a new Snowflake Object

This guide describes the end-to-end process to add support for a new Snowflake object in the Terraform provider. Work is typically split into multiple PRs:

| Step | Description | Example PR |
|------|-------------|------------|
| 1. SDK | Add SDK definitions and unit tests | [#4818](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/pull/4818) |
| 2. Integration Tests | Add SDK integration tests | [#4823](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/pull/4823) |
| 3. Resource | Add resource; register in test provider | [#4852](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/pull/4852) |
| 4. Data Source | Add data source; register in test provider | [#4879](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/pull/4879) |
| 5. Register in Provider | Move from test provider to production provider; add docs and examples | — |

**PR sizing:** Each step above maps to one PR, but treat this as a minimum split, not a maximum. If a step grows too large — especially step 3 for complex resources — split it further. For example, a resource with many attributes or non-trivial behavior can be broken into:
- a basic version (core CRUD, most common attributes, basic acceptance tests)
- handling for remaining or optional attributes
- external change detection and drift handling
- type conversions, parameter blocks, or other advanced behaviors

Reviewers can engage earlier with smaller PRs, and CI is faster to re-run on narrowly scoped changes. When in doubt, split.

#### 1. Add the object to the SDK

Take a look at an example [SDK implementation for Storage Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/pull/4818).

Follow the [Developer Workflow](pkg/sdk/generator/README.md#developer-workflow) section of the SDK Generator README to create the definition file, register it, run generation, and verify idempotency. It covers file conventions, a step-by-step workflow, and the Request DTO builder pattern required when using the generated SDK.

Implement unit tests. `make generate-sdk` always generates SDK unit test skeletons (`*_gen_test.go`) alongside the object's other files — write the companion `*_ext_test.go` to supply expected SQL and default options, per the [Unit test generation](pkg/sdk/generator/README.md#unit-test-generation) section of the SDK Generator README.

#### 2. Add integration tests

Take a look at an example [Integration tests implementation for Storage Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/pull/4823).

Add integration tests under the SDK’s testint package to validate the SDK behavior against a live Snowflake connection.

- Follow the [Objects assertions guide](pkg/acceptance/bettertestspoc/README.md#adding-new-snowflake-object-assertions) to generate the necessary assertions. The test framework provides the following assertion types:
  - `resourceassert` — verifies Terraform state attributes
  - `resourceshowoutputassert` — verifies `show_output` and `describe_output` block values
  - `resourceparametersassert` — verifies `parameters` block values in Terraform state
  - `objectassert` — verifies actual Snowflake object state directly via SDK (not Terraform state)
  - `objectparametersassert` — verifies actual Snowflake parameters directly

#### 3. Add resource

Take a look at an example [Resource implementation for Storage Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/pull/4852).

Implement the resource schema, read/create/update/delete, acceptance tests, and docs. Use the SDK as the source of truth and mirror its SHOW/DESC coverage and validations.

- Schema design
  - Prefer nested blocks for structured inputs. For example, “create from a stage” is modeled as a `from { stage = "<db>.<schema>.<stage>" path = "path/to/file" }` block rather than a flat string, to align with Snowflake semantics and improve validation.

  - Validate identifiers with the provider’s identifier validators (e.g., `IsValidIdentifier[...]`) and suppress quoting-only diffs for identifier fields (`suppressIdentifierQuoting`).

- Update semantics
  - If it's possible, implement rename in-place (`ALTER … RENAME TO …`) rather than ForceNew. Align with how recently refactored resources handle renames.

  - Detect external changes for derived outputs via SHOW/DESC triggers when possible. If a particular field cannot be detected externally (e.g., notebooks “from” location due to Snowflake limitations), document that limitation explicitly in the resource docs.

- Defaults and constraints surfaced in docs
  - Where Snowflake restricts identifier casing (e.g., only upper-case identifiers are valid for specific warehouse references), document it explicitly and add validators to prevent invalid inputs in plans.

- Documentation and migration guide
  - Add a Migration Guide entry under the correct version, grouping object support under a single H3 “(new feature) snowflake_” heading with H4 subsections for “Added resource” and “Added data source”.

  - When server capabilities are incomplete, document current limitations and ensure Update/Create sequences handle supported paths without requiring double-applies. Remember to use the model builder and assertions that you can automatically generate.

  - Add an example usage of the object. It should be auto-included in the generated documentation via the `.md.tmpl` file.

  - The resource's documentation should also include a `Preview feature` section. It could be a good idea to copy-paste and modify one of the existing files located in `templates/resources/*.md.tmpl`.

  - use `make docs` to generate documentation based on the `.md.tmpl` file (which is the file you should edit instead of `.md` file).

- Implement acceptance tests
  - Provide “basic” and “complete” cases; test rename, validations, and plan drift (ConfigPlanChecks). Avoid relying on “Safe” client wrappers for correctness checks; validate against the same paths real users hit.

- Follow the [Schemas guide](pkg/schemas/gen/README.md) to generate show schemas.

- Follow the [Resource assertions guide](pkg/acceptance/bettertestspoc/README.md#adding-new-resource-assertions) to generate the necessary assertions.

- Register the new resource in [`pkg/testacc/1_setup_provider_test.go`](pkg/testacc/1_setup_provider_test.go) (`acceptanceTestsProvider()` function) — **not** in the production provider yet. The resource lives here during the preview/development phase so acceptance tests can run against it.

#### 4. Add data source

Take a look at an example [Data source implementation for Storage Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/pull/4879)

While not strictly required to “support” the object, a data source improves discoverability and enables read-only use cases. For parity with other objects, we recommend adding one.

Example patterns validated by the data source:
- Filtering aligned to SHOW
  - Support `like`, `starts_with`, and `limit { rows, from }` to mirror SHOW filters; include `with_describe` to optionally call DESCRIBE for each item. Keep `with_describe` default-on but allow turning it off to reduce calls in large accounts.

- Output shape
  - Aggregate into a single `<object_name_plural>` collection with nested `show_output` (SHOW) and `describe_output` (DESCRIBE) blocks containing fields as strings/numbers

- Documentation and examples
  - Provide simple, filter, and pagination examples; include a note about default behavior of `with_describe`.

- Provider preview gate and migration guide
  - Add the “Added data source” H4 subsection under the same feature entry in the Migration Guide and link Snowflake’s SHOW docs where appropriate.

- Follow the [Data source config guide](pkg/acceptance/bettertestspoc/README.md#adding-new-datasource-config-model-builders) to generate config model.

- Register the new data source in [`pkg/testacc/1_setup_provider_test.go`](pkg/testacc/1_setup_provider_test.go) (`acceptanceTestsProvider()` function) — **not** in the production provider yet.

#### 5. Register in provider

Once the resource and data source are stable (promoted from preview), move the registrations:

- Move resource/data source registration from `acceptanceTestsProvider()` in `pkg/testacc/1_setup_provider_test.go` to the production provider in `pkg/provider/provider.go`
- Add documentation templates (`templates/resources/`, `templates/data-sources/`) and usage examples (`examples/resources/`, `examples/data-sources/`)
- Run `make docs` to generate final documentation

## Advanced Debugging

If you want to build and test the provider locally (manually, not through acceptance tests), build the binary first using `make build-local` or install to the proper local directory by invoking `make install-tf` (to uninstall run `make uninstall-tf`).

Next, edit your `~/.terraformrc` file to include the following:

```hcl
provider_installation {

  dev_overrides {
      "registry.terraform.io/snowflakedb/snowflake" = "<path_to_binary>"
  }

  direct {}
}
```

To debug the provider with a debugger:

1. Launch the provider with the `-debug` command line argument in your debugger session. Once the provider starts, it will print instructions on setting the `TF_REATTACH_PROVIDERS` environment variable.

   ```sh
   Provider started. To attach Terraform CLI, set the TF_REATTACH_PROVIDERS environment variable with the following:

   Command Prompt:	set "TF_REATTACH_PROVIDERS={"registry.terraform.io/snowflakedb/snowflake":{"Protocol":"grpc","ProtocolVersion":5,"Pid":35140,"Test":true,"Addr": {"Network":"tcp","String":"127.0.0.1:54706"}}}"
   PowerShell:	$env:TF_REATTACH_PROVIDERS='{"registry.terraform.io/snowflakedb/snowflake":{"Protocol":"grpc","ProtocolVersion":5,"Pid":35140,"Test":true,"Addr":{"Network":"tcp","String":"127.0.0.1:54706"}}}'
   ```

2. Open a terminal where you will execute Terraform and set the `TF_REATTACH_PROVIDERS` environment variable using the command from the first step.
3. Run Terraform as usual from this terminal. Any breakpoints you set will halt execution, and you can troubleshoot the provider from your debugger.

**Note**: The `TF_REATTACH_PROVIDERS` environment variable needs to be set every time you restart your debugger session as some values like the `Pid` or the TCP port will change with every execution.

For further instructions, please check the official [Terraform Plugin Development guide](https://www.terraform.io/plugin/debugging#starting-a-provider-in-debug-mode).
