!> **V1 release candidate** This resource was reworked and is a release candidate for the V1. We do not expect significant changes in it before the V1. We will welcome any feedback and adjust the resource if needed. Any errors reported will be resolved with a higher priority. We encourage checking this resource out before the V1 release. Please follow the [migration guide](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md#v0980--v0990) to use it.

-> **Note** For `ACCOUNT` object type, only identifiers with organization name are supported. See [account identifier docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-account-identifier#format-1-preferred-account-name-in-your-organization) for more details.

-> **Note** Tag association resource ID has the following format: `"TAG_DATABASE"."TAG_SCHEMA"."TAG_NAME"|TAG_VALUE|OBJECT_TYPE`. This means that a tuple of tag ID, tag value and object type should be unique across the resources. If you want to specify this combination for more than one object, you should use only one `tag_association` resource with specified `object_identifiers` set.

-> **Note** If you want to change tag value to a value that is already present in another `tag_association` resource, first remove the relevant `object_identifiers` from the resource with the old value, run `terraform apply`, then add the relevant `object_identifiers` in the resource with new value, and run `terrafrom apply` once again.

## Example Usage

{{ tffile (printf "examples/resources/%s/resource.tf" .Name)}}
-> **Note** Instead of using fully_qualified_name, you can reference objects managed outside Terraform by constructing a correct ID, consult [identifiers guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Snowflake-Labs/snowflake/latest/docs/guides/identifiers#new-computed-fully-qualified-name-field-in-resources).
<!-- TODO(SNOW-1634854): include an example showing both methods-->

## Import

~> **Note** Due to technical limitations of Terraform SDK, `object_identifiers` are not set during import state. Please run `terraform refresh` after importing to get this field populated.

Import is supported using the following syntax:

{{ codefile "shell" (printf "examples/resources/%s/import.sh" .Name)}}
{{- end }}
