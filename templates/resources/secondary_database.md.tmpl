!> **Note** The provider does not detect external changes on database type. In this case, remove the database of wrong type manually with `terraform destroy` and recreate the resource. It will be addressed in the future.

!> **Note** A database cannot be dropped successfully if it contains network rule-network policy associations. The error looks like `098507 (2BP01): Cannot drop database DATABASE as it includes network rule - policy associations.`. Currently, the provider does not unassign such objects automatically. Before dropping the resource, first unassign the network rule from the relevant objects. See [guide](../guides/unassigning_policies) for more details.

~> **Note** The snowflake_secondary_database resource doesn't refresh itself, as the best practice is to use tasks scheduled for a certain interval. Check out the examples to see how to set up the refresh task. For SQL-based replication guide, see the [official documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/db-replication-config#replicating-a-database-to-another-account).

## Example Usage

{{ tffile .ExampleFile }}
-> **Note** Instead of using fully_qualified_name, you can reference objects managed outside Terraform by constructing a correct ID, consult [identifiers guide](../guides/identifiers_rework_design_decisions#new-computed-fully-qualified-name-field-in-resources).
<!-- TODO(SNOW-1634854): include an example showing both methods-->
