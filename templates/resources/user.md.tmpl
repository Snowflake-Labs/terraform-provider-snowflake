!> **Caution** Use `network_policy` attribute instead of the [`snowflake_network_policy_attachment`](./network_policy_attachment) resource. `snowflake_network_policy_attachment` will be reworked in the following versions of the provider which may still affect this resource.

!> **Sensitive values** This resource's `display_name`, `show_output.display_name`, `show_output.email`, `show_output.login_name`, `show_output.first_name`, `show_output.middle_name` and `show_output.last_name` fields are not marked as sensitive in the provider. Ensure that no personal data, sensitive data, export-controlled data, or other regulated data is entered as metadata when using the provider. If you use one of these fields, they may be present in logs, so ensure that the provider logs are properly restricted. For more information, see [Sensitive values limitations](../#sensitive-values-limitations) and [Metadata fields in Snowflake](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/metadata).

-> **Note** `snowflake_user_password_policy_attachment` will be reworked in the following versions of the provider which may still affect this resource.

-> **Note** Attaching user policies will be handled in the following versions of the provider which may still affect this resource.

-> **Note** Other two user types are handled in separate resources: `snowflake_service_user` for user type `service` and `snowflake_legacy_service_user` for user type `legacy_service`.

-> **Note** External changes to `days_to_expiry`, `mins_to_unlock`, and `mins_to_bypass_mfa` are not currently handled by the provider (because the value changes continuously on Snowflake side after setting it).

## Example Usage

{{ tffile .ExampleFile }}
-> **Note** Instead of using fully_qualified_name, you can reference objects managed outside Terraform by constructing a correct ID, consult [identifiers guide](../guides/identifiers_rework_design_decisions#new-computed-fully-qualified-name-field-in-resources).
<!-- TODO(SNOW-1634854): include an example showing both methods-->

-> **Note** If a field has a default value, it is shown next to the type in the schema.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

{{ codefile "shell" (printf "examples/resources/%s/import.sh" .Name)}}
{{- end }}

Note: terraform plan+apply may be needed after successful import to fill out all the missing fields (like `password`) in state.
