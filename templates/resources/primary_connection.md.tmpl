!> **V1 release candidate** This resource is a release candidate for the V1. It is on the list of remaining GA objects for V1. We do not expect significant changes in it before the V1. We will welcome any feedback and adjust the resource if needed. Any errors reported will be resolved with a higher priority. We encourage checking this resource out before the V1 release. Please follow the [migration guide](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md#v0970--v0980) to use it.

## Example Usage

{{ tffile (printf "examples/resources/%s/resource.tf" .Name)}}

-> **Note** Instead of using fully_qualified_name, you can reference objects managed outside Terraform by constructing a correct ID, consult [identifiers guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Snowflake-Labs/snowflake/latest/docs/guides/identifiers#new-computed-fully-qualified-name-field-in-resources).

-> **Note** To demote [`snowflake_primary_connection`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Snowflake-Labs/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/primary_connection) to [`snowflake_secondary_connection`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Snowflake-Labs/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/secondary_connection), resources need to be migrated manually. For guidance on removing and importing resources into the state check [resource migration](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/docs/technical-documentation/resource_migration.md). Remove the resource from the state, then recreate it in manually using:
    ```
    CREATE CONNECTION <name> AS REPLICA OF <organization_name>.<account_name>.<connection_name>;
    ```
    and then import it as the `snowflake_secondary_connection`.
<!-- TODO(SNOW-1634854): include an example showing both methods-->
