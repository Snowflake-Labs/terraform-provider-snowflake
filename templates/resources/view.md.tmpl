!> **V1 release candidate** This resource was reworked and is a release candidate for the V1. We do not expect significant changes in it before the V1. We will welcome any feedback and adjust the resource if needed. Any errors reported will be resolved with a higher priority. We encourage checking this resource out before the V1 release. Please follow the [migration guide](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md#v094x--v0950) to use it.

!> **Note about copy_grants** Fields like `is_recursive`, `is_temporary`, `copy_grants` and `statement` can not be altered, and a change means recreation of the resource. ForceNew can not be used because it does not preserve grants from `copy_grants`. Beware that even though a change is marked as update, the resource is recreated.

~> **Required warehouse** For this resource, the provider uses [policy references](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/policy_references) which requires a warehouse in the connection. Please, make sure you have either set a DEFAULT_WAREHOUSE for the user, or specified a warehouse in the configuration.
