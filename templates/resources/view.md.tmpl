!> Due to Snowflake limitations, to properly compute diff on `statement` field, the provider parses a `text` field which contains the whole CREATE query used to create the resource. We recommend not using special characters, especially `(`, `,`, `)` in any of the fields, if possible.

~> **Note about copy_grants** Fields like `is_recursive`, `is_temporary`, `copy_grants` and `statement` can not be ALTERed on Snowflake side (check [docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/alter-view)), and a change on these fields means recreation of the resource. ForceNew can not be used because it does not preserve grants from `copy_grants`. Beware that even though a change is marked as update, the resource is recreated.

~> **Required warehouse** For this resource, the provider uses [policy references](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/policy_references) which requires a warehouse in the connection. Please, make sure you have either set a DEFAULT_WAREHOUSE for the user, or specified a warehouse in the provider configuration.

## Example Usage

{{ tffile (printf "examples/resources/%s/resource.tf" .Name)}}
-> **Note** Instead of using fully_qualified_name, you can reference objects managed outside Terraform by constructing a correct ID, consult [identifiers guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Snowflake-Labs/snowflake/latest/docs/guides/identifiers#new-computed-fully-qualified-name-field-in-resources).
<!-- TODO(SNOW-1634854): include an example showing both methods-->
