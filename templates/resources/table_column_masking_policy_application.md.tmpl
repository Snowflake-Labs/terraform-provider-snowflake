!> **Caution: Preview Feature** This feature is considered a preview feature in the provider, regardless of the state of the resource in Snowflake. We do not guarantee its stability. It will be reworked and marked as a stable feature in future releases. Breaking changes are expected, even without bumping the major version. To use this feature, add the relevant feature name to `preview_features_enabled field` in the [provider configuration](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Snowflake-Labs/snowflake/latest/docs#schema). Please always refer to the [Getting Help](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/terraform-provider-snowflake?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-help) section in our Github repo to best determine how to get help for your questions.

# {{.Name}} ({{.Type}})

{{ .Description | trimspace }}

Only one masking policy may be applied per table column, hence only one `{{.Name}}` resources may be present per table column.
Using two or more `{{.Name}}` resources for the same table column will result in the last one overriding any previously applied masking policies and unresolvable diffs in Terraform plan.

When using this resource to manage a table column's masking policy make sure to ignore changes to the column's masking policy in the table definition, otherwise the two resources would conflict. See example below.

## Example Usage

{{ tffile .ExampleFile }}
-> **Note** Instead of using fully_qualified_name, you can reference objects managed outside Terraform by constructing a correct ID, consult [identifiers guide](../guides/identifiers_rework_design_decisions#new-computed-fully-qualified-name-field-in-resources).
<!-- TODO(SNOW-1634854): include an example showing both methods-->
