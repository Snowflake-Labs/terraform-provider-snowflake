# {{.Name}} ({{.Type}})

!> **Warning** This is a dangerous resource that allows executing **ANY** SQL statement. It may destroy resources if used incorrectly. It may behave incorrectly combined with other resources. Use at your own risk.

~> **Note** It can be theoretically used to manage resource that are not supported by the provider. This is risky and may brake other resources if used incorrectly.

~> **Note** Use `query` parameter with caution. It will fetch **ALL** the results returned by the query provided. Try to limit the number of results by writing query with filters. Query failure does not stop resource creation; it simply results in `query_results` being empty.

## Example Usage

{{ tffile (printf "examples/resources/%s/resource.tf" .Name)}}
-> **Note** Instead of using fully_qualified_name, you can reference objects managed outside Terraform by constructing a correct ID, consult [identifiers guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Snowflake-Labs/snowflake/latest/docs/guides/identifiers#new-computed-fully-qualified-name-field-in-resources).
<!-- TODO(SNOW-1634854): include an example showing both methods-->
