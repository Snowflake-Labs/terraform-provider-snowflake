!> **Note** The provider does not detect external changes on database type. In this case, remove the database of wrong type manually with `terraform destroy` and recreate the resource. It will be addressed in the future.

!> **Note** A database cannot be dropped successfully if it contains network rule-network policy associations. The error looks like `098507 (2BP01): Cannot drop database DATABASE as it includes network rule - policy associations.`. Currently, the provider does not unassign such objects automatically. Before dropping the resource, first unassign the network rule from the relevant objects. See [guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Snowflake-Labs/snowflake/latest/docs/guides/unassigning_policies) for more details.

## Example Usage

{{ tffile (printf "examples/resources/%s/resource.tf" .Name)}}
-> **Note** Instead of using fully_qualified_name, you can reference objects managed outside Terraform by constructing a correct ID, consult [identifiers guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Snowflake-Labs/snowflake/latest/docs/guides/identifiers#new-computed-fully-qualified-name-field-in-resources).
<!-- TODO(SNOW-1634854): include an example showing both methods-->
