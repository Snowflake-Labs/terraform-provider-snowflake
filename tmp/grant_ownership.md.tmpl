!> **Warning** We're in a process of implementing this resource, so it's not available yet.

~> **Note** This is a preview resource. It's ready for general use. In case of any errors, please file an issue in our GitHub repository.
~> **Note** For more details about granting ownership, please visit [`GRANT OWNERSHIP` Snowflake documentation page](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/grant-ownership).

{{/* TODO: Add note on how on_future works - could be also added to other grant resources with on_future option */}}
{{/* TODO: Add warnings If on_all option will be available - during delete user could transfer ownership of not intended objects due to it's nature */}}

## Granting ownership on pipes
To transfer ownership of a pipe, there must be additional conditions met. Otherwise, additional manual work
will be needed afterward or in some cases, the ownership won't be transferred (resulting in error).

To transfer ownership of a pipe(s) **fully automatically**, one of the following conditions has to be met:
- OPERATE and MONITOR privileges are granted to the current role on the pipe(s) and `outbound_privileges` field is set to `COPY`.
- The pipe(s) running status is paused (additional privileges and fields set are needed to pause and resume the pipe before and after ownership transfer. If it's already paused, nothing additional is needed and the pipe will remain paused after the ownership transfer).

To transfer ownership of a pipe(s) **semi-automatically** you have to:
1. Pause the pipe(s) you want to transfer ownership of (using [ALTER PIPE](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/alter-pipe#syntax); see PIPE_EXECUTION_PAUSED).
2. Create Terraform configuration with the `snowflake_grant_ownership` resource and perform ownership transfer with the `terraform apply`.
3. To resume the pipe(s) after ownership transfer use [PIPE_FORCE_RESUME system function](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/system_pipe_force_resume).

## Import

~> **Note** All the ..._name parts should be fully qualified names (where every part is quoted), e.g. for schema object it is `"<database_name>"."<schema_name>"."<object_name>"`

Import is supported using the following syntax:

`terraform import "<role_type>|<role_identifier>|<outbound_privileges_behavior>|<grant_type>|<grant_data>"`

where:
- role_type - string - type of granted role (either ToAccountRole or ToDatabaseRole)
- role_name - string - fully qualified identifier for either account role or database role (depending on the role_type)
- outbound_privileges_behavior - string - behavior specified for existing roles (can be either COPY or REVOKE)
- grant_type - enum
- grant_data - data dependent on grant_type

It has varying number of parts, depending on grant_type. All the possible types are:
