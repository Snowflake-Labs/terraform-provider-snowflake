/*
The following tests are showing the behavior of the provider in cases where objects higher in the hierarchy
like database or schema are renamed when the objects lower in the hierarchy are in the Terraform configuration.
For more information check TODO(SNOW-1672319): link public document.

Shallow hierarchy (database + schema)
- is in config - renamed internally - with implicit dependency (works)

- is in config - renamed internally - without dependency - after rename schema referencing old database name (fails in Read and then it's failing to remove itself in Delete)
- is in config - renamed internally - without dependency - after rename schema referencing new database name (fails in Read and then it's failing to remove itself in Delete)

- is in config - renamed internally - with depends_on - after rename schema referencing old database name (fails in Read and then it's failing to remove itself in Delete)
- is in config - renamed internally - with depends_on - after rename schema referencing new database name (works)

- is in config - renamed externally - with implicit dependency - database holding the same name in config (works; creates a new database with a schema next to the already existing renamed database and schema)
- is in config - renamed externally - with implicit dependency - database holding the new name in config  (fails to create database, because it already exists)

- is in config - renamed externally - without dependency - after rename database referencing old name and schema referencing old database name (non-deterministic results depending on the Terraform execution order that seems to be different with every run)
- is in config - renamed externally - without dependency - after rename database referencing old name and schema referencing old database name - check impact of the resource order on the plan (seems to fail pretty consistently in Delete because database is dropped before schema)
- is in config - renamed externally - without dependency - after rename database referencing old name and schema referencing new database name (fails because schema resource tries to create a new schema that already exists in renamed database)
- is in config - renamed externally - without dependency - after rename database referencing new name and schema referencing old database name (fails because database resource tried to create database that already exists)
- is in config - renamed externally - without dependency - after rename database referencing new name and schema referencing new database name (fails because database resource tried to create database that already exists)

- is in config - renamed externally - with depends_on - after rename database referencing old name and schema referencing old database name (works; creates a new database with a schema next to the already existing renamed database and schema)
- is in config - renamed externally - with depends_on - after rename database referencing old name and schema referencing new database name (fails because schema resource tries to create a new schema that already exists in renamed database)
- is in config - renamed externally - with depends_on - after rename database referencing new name and schema referencing old database name (fails because database resource tried to create database that already exists)
- is in config - renamed externally - with depends_on - after rename database referencing new name and schema referencing new database name (fails because database resource tried to create database that already exists)

- is not in config - renamed externally - referencing old database name (fails because it tries to create a new schema on non-existing database)
- is not in config - renamed externally - referencing new database name (fails because schema resource tries to create a new schema that already exists in renamed database)

- (Deep hierarchy) More test cases could be added when database and schema are renamed at the same time
- (Deep hierarchy) More test cases could be added when either database or schema are in the config
