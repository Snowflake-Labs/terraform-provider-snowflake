This is a terraform provider for managing [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/) resources.

## Getting started

> If you're still using the `chanzuckerberg/snowflake` source, see [Upgrading from CZI Provider](./CZI_UPGRADE.md) to upgrade to the current version.

Install the Snowflake Terraform provider by adding a requirement block and a provider block to your Terraform codebase:
```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    snowflake = {
      source  = "Snowflake-Labs/snowflake"
      version = "~> 0.61"
    }
  }
}

provider "snowflake" {
  account  = "abc12345" # the Snowflake account identifier
  username = "johndoe"
  password = "v3ry$3cr3t"
  role     = "ACCOUNTADMIN"
}
```

For more information on provider configuration see the [provider docs on the Terraform registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Snowflake-Labs/snowflake/latest/docs).

Don't forget to run `terraform init` and you're ready to go! 🚀

Start browsing the [registry docs](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Snowflake-Labs/snowflake/latest/docs) to find resources and data sources to use.
