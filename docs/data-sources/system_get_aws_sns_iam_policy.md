!> **Caution: Preview Feature** This feature is considered a preview feature in the provider, regardless of the state of the resource in Snowflake. We do not guarantee its stability. It will be reworked and marked as a stable feature in future releases. Breaking changes are expected, even without bumping the major version. To use this feature, add the relevant feature name to `preview_features_enabled field` in the [provider configuration](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Snowflake-Labs/snowflake/latest/docs#schema). Please always refer to the [Getting Help](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/terraform-provider-snowflake?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-help) section in our Github repo to best determine how to get help for your questions.

# snowflake_system_get_aws_sns_iam_policy (Data Source)



For more details, visit the official Snowflake documentation: https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/system_get_aws_sns_iam_policy.
Read this guide to understand how to use the snowflake_system_get_aws_sns_iam_policy to integrate with AWS: https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-auto-s3#step-1-subscribe-the-snowflake-sqs-queue-to-the-sns-topic.
It's SQL-based, but after knowing what has to be done use corresponding resources and data-sources from the Snowflake and AWS Terraform provider.
