!> **V1 release candidate** This data source was reworked and is a release candidate for the V1. We do not expect significant changes in it before the V1. We will welcome any feedback and adjust the data source if needed. Any errors reported will be resolved with a higher priority. We encourage checking this data source out before the V1 release. Please follow the [migration guide](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md#v094x--v0950) to use it.

# snowflake_views (Data Source)

Data source used to get details of filtered views. Filtering is aligned with the current possibilities for [SHOW VIEWS](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/show-views) query (only `like` is supported). The results of SHOW and DESCRIBE are encapsulated in one output collection `views`.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Simple usage
data "snowflake_views" "simple" {
}

output "simple_output" {
  value = data.snowflake_views.simple.views
}

# Filtering (like)
data "snowflake_views" "like" {
  like = "view-name"
}

output "like_output" {
  value = data.snowflake_views.like.views
}

# Filtering by prefix (like)
data "snowflake_views" "like_prefix" {
  like = "prefix%"
}

output "like_prefix_output" {
  value = data.snowflake_views.like_prefix.views
}

# Filtering (limit)
data "snowflake_views" "limit" {
  limit {
    rows = 10
    from = "prefix-"
  }
}

output "limit_output" {
  value = data.snowflake_views.limit.views
}

# Filtering (in)
data "snowflake_views" "in" {
  in {
    database = "database"
  }
}

output "in_output" {
  value = data.snowflake_views.in.views
}

# Without additional data (to limit the number of calls make for every found view)
data "snowflake_views" "only_show" {
  # with_describe is turned on by default and it calls DESCRIBE VIEW for every view found and attaches its output to views.*.describe_output field
  with_describe = false
}

output "only_show_output" {
  value = data.snowflake_views.only_show.views
}

# Ensure the number of views is equal to at least one element (with the use of postcondition)
data "snowflake_views" "assert_with_postcondition" {
  like = "view-name%"
  lifecycle {
    postcondition {
      condition     = length(self.views) > 0
      error_message = "there should be at least one view"
    }
  }
}

# Ensure the number of views is equal to at exactly one element (with the use of check block)
check "view_check" {
  data "snowflake_views" "assert_with_check_block" {
    like = "view-name"
  }

  assert {
    condition     = length(data.snowflake_views.assert_with_check_block.views) == 1
    error_message = "views filtered by '${data.snowflake_views.assert_with_check_block.like}' returned ${length(data.snowflake_views.assert_with_check_block.views)} views where one was expected"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `in` (Block List, Max: 1) IN clause to filter the list of views (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--in))
- `like` (String) Filters the output with **case-insensitive** pattern, with support for SQL wildcard characters (`%` and `_`).
- `limit` (Block List, Max: 1) Limits the number of rows returned. If the `limit.from` is set, then the limit wll start from the first element matched by the expression. The expression is only used to match with the first element, later on the elements are not matched by the prefix, but you can enforce a certain pattern with `starts_with` or `like`. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--limit))
- `starts_with` (String) Filters the output with **case-sensitive** characters indicating the beginning of the object name.
- `with_describe` (Boolean) Runs DESC VIEW for each view returned by SHOW VIEWS. The output of describe is saved to the description field. By default this value is set to true.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `views` (List of Object) Holds the aggregated output of all views details queries. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--views))

<a id="nestedblock--in"></a>
### Nested Schema for `in`

Optional:

- `account` (Boolean) Returns records for the entire account.
- `database` (String) Returns records for the current database in use or for a specified database.
- `schema` (String) Returns records for the current schema in use or a specified schema. Use fully qualified name.


<a id="nestedblock--limit"></a>
### Nested Schema for `limit`

Required:

- `rows` (Number) The maximum number of rows to return.

Optional:

- `from` (String) Specifies a **case-sensitive** pattern that is used to match object name. After the first match, the limit on the number of rows will be applied.


<a id="nestedatt--views"></a>
### Nested Schema for `views`

Read-Only:

- `describe_output` (List of Object) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedobjatt--views--describe_output))
