!> **V1 release candidate** This data source was reworked and is a release candidate for the V1. We do not expect significant changes in it before the V1. We will welcome any feedback and adjust the data source if needed. Any errors reported will be resolved with a higher priority. We encourage checking this data source out before the V1 release. Please follow the [migration guide](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md#v0950--v0960) to use it.

# snowflake_resource_monitors (Data Source)

Data source used to get details of filtered resource monitors. Filtering is aligned with the current possibilities for [SHOW RESOURCE MONITORS](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/show-resource-monitors) query (`like` is supported). The results of SHOW is encapsulated in show_output collection.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Simple usage
data "snowflake_resource_monitors" "simple" {
}

output "simple_output" {
  value = data.snowflake_resource_monitors.simple.resource_monitors
}

# Filtering (like)
data "snowflake_resource_monitors" "like" {
  like = "resource-monitor-name"
}

output "like_output" {
  value = data.snowflake_resource_monitors.like.resource_monitors
}

# Ensure the number of resource monitors is equal to at least one element (with the use of postcondition)
data "snowflake_resource_monitors" "assert_with_postcondition" {
  like = "resource-monitor-name-%"
  lifecycle {
    postcondition {
      condition     = length(self.resource_monitors) > 0
      error_message = "there should be at least one resource monitor"
    }
  }
}

# Ensure the number of resource monitors is equal to at exactly one element (with the use of check block)
check "resource_monitor_check" {
  data "snowflake_resource_monitors" "assert_with_check_block" {
    like = "resource-monitor-name"
  }

  assert {
    condition     = length(data.snowflake_resource_monitors.assert_with_check_block.resource_monitors) == 1
    error_message = "Resource monitors filtered by '${data.snowflake_resource_monitors.assert_with_check_block.like}' returned ${length(data.snowflake_resource_monitors.assert_with_check_block.resource_monitors)} resource monitors where one was expected"
  }
}
```
