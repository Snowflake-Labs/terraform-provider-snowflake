# snowflake_pipe_grant (Resource)

~> **Deprecation** This resource is deprecated and will be removed in a future major version release. Please use [snowflake_grant_privileges_to_account_role](./grant_privileges_to_account_role) instead. <deprecation>

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "snowflake_pipe_grant" "grant" {
  database_name = "database"
  schema_name   = "schema"
  pipe_name     = "pipe"

  privilege = "OPERATE"
  roles     = ["role1", "role2"]

  on_future         = false
  with_grant_option = false
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `database_name` (String) The name of the database containing the current or future pipes on which to grant privileges.

### Optional

- `enable_multiple_grants` (Boolean) When this is set to true, multiple grants of the same type can be created. This will cause Terraform to not revoke grants applied to roles and objects outside Terraform.
- `on_future` (Boolean) When this is set to true and a schema_name is provided, apply this grant on all future pipes in the given schema. When this is true and no schema_name is provided apply this grant on all future pipes in the given database. The pipe_name field must be unset in order to use on_future.
- `pipe_name` (String) The name of the pipe on which to grant privileges immediately (only valid if on_future is false).
- `privilege` (String) The privilege to grant on the current or future pipe. To grant all privileges, use the value `ALL PRIVILEGES`
- `revert_ownership_to_role_name` (String) The name of the role to revert ownership to on destroy. Has no effect unless `privilege` is set to `OWNERSHIP`
- `roles` (Set of String) Grants privilege to these roles.
- `schema_name` (String) The name of the schema containing the current or future pipes on which to grant privileges.
- `with_grant_option` (Boolean) When this is set to true, allows the recipient role to grant the privileges to other roles.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
