# snowflake_pipe_grant (Resource)



## Example Usage

```terraform
resource snowflake_pipe_grant grant {
  database_name = "db"
  schema_name   = "schema"
  sequence_name = "sequence"

  privilege = "operate"
  roles = [
    "role1",
    "role2",
  ]

  on_future         = false
  with_grant_option = false
}
```

### Optional

- **on_future** (Boolean) When this is set to true and a schema_name is provided, apply this grant on all future pipes in the given schema. When this is true and no schema_name is provided apply this grant on all future pipes in the given database. The pipe_name field must be unset in order to use on_future.
- **pipe_name** (String) The name of the pipe on which to grant privileges immediately (only valid if on_future is false).

- **with_grant_option** (Boolean) When this is set to true, allows the recipient role to grant the privileges to other roles.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# format is database name | schema name | pipe name | privilege | true/false for with_grant_option
terraform import snowflake_pipe_grant.example 'dbName|schemaName|pipeName|OPERATE|false'
```
