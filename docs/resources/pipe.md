!> **Caution: Preview Feature** This feature is considered a preview feature in the provider, regardless of the state of the resource in Snowflake. We do not guarantee its stability. It will be reworked and marked as a stable feature in future releases. Breaking changes are expected, even without bumping the major version. To use this feature, add the relevant feature name to `preview_features_enabled field` in the [provider configuration](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Snowflake-Labs/snowflake/latest/docs#schema). Please always refer to the [Getting Help](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/terraform-provider-snowflake?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-help) section in our Github repo to best determine how to get help for your questions.

# snowflake_pipe (Resource)

~> **Note** Right now, changes for the `integration` field are not detected. This will be resolved in the [upcoming refactoring](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/ROADMAP.md#preparing-essential-ga-objects-for-the-provider-v1). For now, please try to use the [replace_triggered_by](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle#replace_triggered_by) HCL meta-argument.



## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "snowflake_pipe" "pipe" {
  database = "db"
  schema   = "schema"
  name     = "pipe"

  comment = "A pipe."

  copy_statement = "copy into mytable from @mystage"
  auto_ingest    = false

  aws_sns_topic_arn    = "..."
  notification_channel = "..."
}
```
-> **Note** Instead of using fully_qualified_name, you can reference objects managed outside Terraform by constructing a correct ID, consult [identifiers guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Snowflake-Labs/snowflake/latest/docs/guides/identifiers#new-computed-fully-qualified-name-field-in-resources).
<!-- TODO(SNOW-1634854): include an example showing both methods-->
