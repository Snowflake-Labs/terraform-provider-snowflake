# snowflake_authentication_policy (Resource)





<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `database` (String) The database in which to create the authentication policy.
- `name` (String) Specifies the identifier for the authentication policy.
- `schema` (String) The schema in which to create the authentication policy.

### Optional

- `authentication_methods` (Set of String) A list of authentication methods that are allowed during login. This parameter accepts one or more of the following values: ALL, SAML, PASSWORD, OAUTH, KEYPAIR.
- `client_types` (Set of String) A list of clients that can authenticate with Snowflake. If a client tries to connect, and the client is not one of the valid CLIENT_TYPES, then the login attempt fails. Allowed values are ALL, SNOWFLAKE_UI, DRIVERS, SNOWSQL. The CLIENT_TYPES property of an authentication policy is a best effort method to block user logins based on specific clients. It should not be used as the sole control to establish a security boundary.
- `comment` (String) Specifies a comment for the authentication policy.
- `mfa_authentication_methods` (Set of String) A list of authentication methods that enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) during login. Authentication methods not listed in this parameter do not prompt for multi-factor authentication. Allowed values are SAML and PASSWORD.
- `mfa_enrollment` (String) Determines whether a user must enroll in multi-factor authentication. Allowed values are REQUIRED and OPTIONAL. When REQUIRED is specified, Enforces users to enroll in MFA. If this value is used, then the CLIENT_TYPES parameter must include SNOWFLAKE_UI, because Snowsight is the only place users can enroll in multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- `security_integrations` (Set of String) A list of security integrations the authentication policy is associated with. This parameter has no effect when SAML or OAUTH are not in the AUTHENTICATION_METHODS list. All values in the SECURITY_INTEGRATIONS list must be compatible with the values in the AUTHENTICATION_METHODS list. For example, if SECURITY_INTEGRATIONS contains a SAML security integration, and AUTHENTICATION_METHODS contains OAUTH, then you cannot create the authentication policy. To allow all security integrations use ALL as parameter.

### Read-Only

- `fully_qualified_name` (String) Fully qualified name of the resource. For more information, see [object name resolution](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/name-resolution).
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
