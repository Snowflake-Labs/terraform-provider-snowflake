# snowflake_schema_grant (Resource)



## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "snowflake_schema_grant" "grant" {
  database_name = "database"
  schema_name   = "schema"

  privilege = "USAGE"
  roles     = ["role1", "role2"]
  shares    = ["share1", "share2"]

  on_future         = false
  with_grant_option = false
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `database_name` (String) The name of the database containing the schema on which to grant privileges.

### Optional

- `enable_multiple_grants` (Boolean) When this is set to true, multiple grants of the same type can be created. This will cause Terraform to not revoke grants applied to roles and objects outside Terraform.
- `on_all` (Boolean) When this is set to true, apply this grant on all schemas in the given database. The schema_name and shares fields must be unset in order to use on_all. Cannot be used together with on_future. Importing the resource with the on_all=true option is not supported.
- `on_future` (Boolean) When this is set to true, apply this grant on all future schemas in the given database. The schema_name and shares fields must be unset in order to use on_future. Cannot be used together with on_all.
- `privilege` (String) The privilege to grant on the current or future schema. Note that if "OWNERSHIP" is specified, ensure that the role that terraform is using is granted access.
- `roles` (Set of String) Grants privilege to these roles.
- `schema_name` (String) The name of the schema on which to grant privileges.
- `shares` (Set of String) Grants privilege to these shares (only valid if on_future and on_all are unset).
- `with_grant_option` (Boolean) When this is set to true, allows the recipient role to grant the privileges to other roles.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# format is database_name | schema_name | privilege | with_grant_option | roles | shares
terraform import snowflake_schema_grant.example 'MY_DATABASE|MY_SCHEMA|MONITOR|false|role1,role2|share1,share2'
```
