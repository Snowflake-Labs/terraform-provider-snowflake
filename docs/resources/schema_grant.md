### Optional

- **shares** (Set of String) Grants privilege to these shares (only valid if on_future is unset).

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# format is database name | schema name | | privilege | true/false for with_grant_option
terraform import snowflake_schema_grant.example 'databaseName|schemaName||MONITOR|false'
```
