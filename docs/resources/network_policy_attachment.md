## Schema

### Required

- **network_policy_name** (String) Specifies the identifier for the network policy; must be unique for the account in which the network policy is created.

### Optional

- **id** (String) The ID of this resource.
- **set_for_account** (Boolean) Specifies whether the network policy should be applied globally to your Snowflake account<br><br>**Note:** The Snowflake user running `terraform apply` must be on an IP address allowed by the network policy to set that policy globally on the Snowflake account.<br><br>Additionally, a Snowflake account can only have one network policy set globally at any given time. This resource does not enforce one-policy-per-account, it is the user's responsibility to enforce this. If multiple network policy resources have `set_for_account: true`, the final policy set on the account will be non-deterministic.
- **users** (Set of String) Specifies which users the network policy should be attached to
