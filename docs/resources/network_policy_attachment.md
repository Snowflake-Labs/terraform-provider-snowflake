resource "snowflake_network_policy_attachment" "attach" {

-> **Note** If you don't manage referenced objects in Terraform, you can construct the proper id yourself, consult [identifiers guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Snowflake-Labs/snowflake/latest/docs/guides/identifiers#new-computed-fully-qualified-name-field-in-resources)
<!-- TODO(SNOW-1634854): include an example showing both methods-->

## Schema

### Required

- `network_policy_name` (String) Specifies the identifier for the network policy; must be unique for the account in which the network policy is created.

### Optional

- `set_for_account` (Boolean) Specifies whether the network policy should be applied globally to your Snowflake account<br><br>**Note:** The Snowflake user running `terraform apply` must be on an IP address allowed by the network policy to set that policy globally on the Snowflake account.<br><br>Additionally, a Snowflake account can only have one network policy set globally at any given time. This resource does not enforce one-policy-per-account, it is the user's responsibility to enforce this. If multiple network policy resources have `set_for_account: true`, the final policy set on the account will be non-deterministic.
- `users` (Set of String) Specifies which users the network policy should be attached to

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
