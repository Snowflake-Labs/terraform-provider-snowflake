  Resource used to control network traffic. For more information, check an official guide https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/network-policies on controlling network traffic with network policies.
---

!> **Note** According to Snowflake [docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/drop-network-policy#usage-notes), a network policy cannot be dropped successfully if it is currently assigned to another object. Currently, the provider does not unassign such objects automatically. Before dropping the resource, first unassign the policy from the relevant objects. See [guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Snowflake-Labs/snowflake/latest/docs/guides/unassigning_policies) for more details.

!> **Note** Due to technical limitations in Terraform SDK, changes in `allowed_network_rule_list` and `blocked_network_rule_list` do not cause diff for `show_output` and `describe_output`.

# snowflake_network_policy (Resource)

Resource used to control network traffic. For more information, check an [official guide](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/network-policies) on controlling network traffic with network policies.

## Example Usage

```terraform
## Minimal
resource "snowflake_network_policy" "basic" {
  name = "network_policy_name"
}

## Complete (with every optional set)
resource "snowflake_network_policy" "complete" {
  name                      = "network_policy_name"
  allowed_network_rule_list = [snowflake_network_rule.one.fully_qualified_name]
  blocked_network_rule_list = [snowflake_network_rule.two.fully_qualified_name]
  allowed_ip_list           = ["192.168.1.0/24"]
  blocked_ip_list           = ["192.168.1.99"]
  comment                   = "my network policy"
}
```
-> **Note** Instead of using fully_qualified_name, you can reference objects managed outside Terraform by constructing a correct ID, consult [identifiers guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Snowflake-Labs/snowflake/latest/docs/guides/identifiers#new-computed-fully-qualified-name-field-in-resources).
<!-- TODO(SNOW-1634854): include an example showing both methods-->

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Specifies the identifier for the network policy; must be unique for the account in which the network policy is created. Due to technical limitations (read more [here](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/docs/technical-documentation/identifiers_rework_design_decisions.md#known-limitations-and-identifier-recommendations)), avoid using the following characters: `|`, `.`, `"`.

### Optional

- `allowed_ip_list` (Set of String) Specifies one or more IPv4 addresses (CIDR notation) that are allowed access to your Snowflake account.
- `allowed_network_rule_list` (Set of String) Specifies a list of fully qualified network rules that contain the network identifiers that are allowed access to Snowflake. For more information about this resource, see [docs](./network_rule).
- `blocked_ip_list` (Set of String) Specifies one or more IPv4 addresses (CIDR notation) that are denied access to your Snowflake account. **Do not** add `0.0.0.0/0` to `blocked_ip_list`, in order to block all IP addresses except a select list, you only need to add IP addresses to `allowed_ip_list`.
- `blocked_network_rule_list` (Set of String) Specifies a list of fully qualified network rules that contain the network identifiers that are denied access to Snowflake. For more information about this resource, see [docs](./network_rule).
- `comment` (String) Specifies a comment for the network policy.

### Read-Only

- `describe_output` (List of Object) Outputs the result of `DESCRIBE NETWORK POLICY` for the given network policy. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--describe_output))
- `fully_qualified_name` (String) Fully qualified name of the resource. For more information, see [object name resolution](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/name-resolution).
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `show_output` (List of Object) Outputs the result of `SHOW NETWORK POLICIES` for the given network policy. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--show_output))
