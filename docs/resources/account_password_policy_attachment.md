# snowflake_account_password_policy_attachment (Resource)

Specifies the password policy to use for the current account. To set the password policy of a different account, use a provider alias.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "snowflake_password_policy" "default" {
  database = "prod"
  schema   = "security"
  name     = "default_policy"
}

resource "snowflake_account_password_policy_attachment" "attachment" {
  password_policy = snowflake_password_policy.default.fully_qualified_name
}
```

-> **Note** Instead of using fully_qualified_name, you can reference objects managed outside Terraform by constructing a correct ID, consult [identifiers guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Snowflake-Labs/snowflake/latest/docs/guides/identifiers#new-computed-fully-qualified-name-field-in-resources).
