  roles         = ["TEST_ROLE"]

- `roles` (Set of String) Grants privilege to these roles.
- `with_grant_option` (Boolean) When this is set to true, allows the recipient role to grant the privileges to other roles.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

```shell
# format is database|schema|tag|privilege|with_grant_option|roles
