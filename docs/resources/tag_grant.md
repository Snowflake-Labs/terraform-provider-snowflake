# snowflake_tag_grant (Resource)

~> **Deprecation** This resource is deprecated and will be removed in a future major version release. Please use [snowflake_grant_privileges_to_account_role](./grant_privileges_to_account_role) instead. <deprecation>

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "snowflake_tag_grant" "example" {
  database_name = "database"
  schema_name   = "schema"
  tag_name      = "tag"
  roles         = ["TEST_ROLE"]
  privilege     = "OWNERSHIP"

}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

- `schema_name` (String) The name of the schema containing the tag on which to grant privileges.
- `tag_name` (String) The name of the tag on which to grant privileges.

### Optional

- `enable_multiple_grants` (Boolean) When this is set to true, multiple grants of the same type can be created. This will cause Terraform to not revoke grants applied to roles and objects outside Terraform.
- `privilege` (String) The privilege to grant on the tag. To grant all privileges, use the value `ALL PRIVILEGES`.
- `revert_ownership_to_role_name` (String) The name of the role to revert ownership to on destroy. Has no effect unless `privilege` is set to `OWNERSHIP`
- `roles` (Set of String) Grants privilege to these roles.
- `with_grant_option` (Boolean) When this is set to true, allows the recipient role to grant the privileges to other roles.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

```shell
# format is database|schema|tag|privilege|with_grant_option|roles
