## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "snowflake_masking_policy_grant" "example" {
  masking_policy_name    = "EXAMPLE_MASKING_POLICY_NAME"
  database_name          = "EXAMPLE_DB_NAME"
  schema_name            = "EXAMPLE_SCHEMA_NAME"
  privilege              = "APPLY"
  roles                  = ["ROLE1_NAME", "ROLE2_NAME"]
  with_grant_option      = true
  enable_multiple_grants = true

## Schema

### Required

- `database_name` (String) The name of the database containing the masking policy on which to grant privileges.
- `masking_policy_name` (String) The name of the masking policy on which to grant privileges immediately.
- `schema_name` (String) The name of the schema containing the masking policy on which to grant privileges.

### Optional

- `enable_multiple_grants` (Boolean) When this is set to true, multiple grants of the same type can be created. This will cause Terraform to not revoke grants applied to roles and objects outside Terraform.
- `privilege` (String) The privilege to grant on the masking policy. To grant all privileges, use the value `ALL PRIVILEGES`
- `revert_ownership_to_role_name` (String) The name of the role to revert ownership to on destroy. Has no effect unless `privilege` is set to `OWNERSHIP`
- `roles` (Set of String) Grants privilege to these roles.
- `with_grant_option` (Boolean) When this is set to true, allows the recipient role to grant the privileges to other roles.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

## Import

```shell
# format is database_name|schema_name|masking_policy_name|privilege|with_grant_option|roles
terraform import snowflake_masking_policy_grant.example "dbName|schemaName|maskingPolicyName|USAGE|false|role1,role2"
```
