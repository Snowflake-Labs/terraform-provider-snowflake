## Example Usage

```terraform
# basic resource
resource "snowflake_schema" "schema" {
  name     = "schema_name"
  database = "database_name"
}

resource "snowflake_database" "primary" {
  name                = "schema_name"
  database            = "database_name"
  with_managed_access = true

## Schema

### Required

- `database` (String) The database in which to create the schema.
- `name` (String) Specifies the identifier for the schema; must be unique for the database in which the schema is created.

### Optional

- `catalog` (String) The database parameter that specifies the default catalog to use for Iceberg tables.
- `comment` (String) Specifies a comment for the schema.
- `data_retention_time_in_days` (Number) Specifies the number of days for which Time Travel actions (CLONE and UNDROP) can be performed on the database, as well as specifying the default Time Travel retention time for all schemas created in the database. For more details, see [Understanding & Using Time Travel](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-time-travel).
- `default_ddl_collation` (String) Specifies a default collation specification for all schemas and tables added to the database. It can be overridden on schema or table level. For more information, see [collation specification](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/collation#label-collation-specification).
- `enable_console_output` (Boolean) If true, enables stdout/stderr fast path logging for anonymous stored procedures.
- `external_volume` (String) The database parameter that specifies the default external volume to use for Iceberg tables.
- `is_transient` (Boolean) Specifies the schema as transient. Transient schemas do not have a Fail-safe period so they do not incur additional storage costs once they leave Time Travel; however, this means they are also not protected by Fail-safe in the event of a data loss.
- `log_level` (String) Specifies the severity level of messages that should be ingested and made available in the active event table. Valid options are: [TRACE DEBUG INFO WARN ERROR FATAL OFF]. Messages at the specified level (and at more severe levels) are ingested. For more information, see [LOG_LEVEL](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/parameters.html#label-log-level).
- `max_data_extension_time_in_days` (Number) Object parameter that specifies the maximum number of days for which Snowflake can extend the data retention period for tables in the database to prevent streams on the tables from becoming stale. For a detailed description of this parameter, see [MAX_DATA_EXTENSION_TIME_IN_DAYS](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/parameters.html#label-max-data-extension-time-in-days).
- `pipe_execution_paused` (Boolean) Specifies whether to pause a running pipe, primarily in preparation for transferring ownership of the pipe to a different role.
- `quoted_identifiers_ignore_case` (Boolean) If true, the case of quoted identifiers is ignored.
- `replace_invalid_characters` (Boolean) Specifies whether to replace invalid UTF-8 characters with the Unicode replacement character (ï¿½) in query results for an Iceberg table. You can only set this parameter for tables that use an external Iceberg catalog.
- `storage_serialization_policy` (String) The storage serialization policy for Iceberg tables that use Snowflake as the catalog. Valid options are: [COMPATIBLE OPTIMIZED]. COMPATIBLE: Snowflake performs encoding and compression of data files that ensures interoperability with third-party compute engines. OPTIMIZED: Snowflake performs encoding and compression of data files that ensures the best table performance within Snowflake.
- `suspend_task_after_num_failures` (Number) How many times a task must fail in a row before it is automatically suspended. 0 disables auto-suspending.
- `tag` (Block List, Deprecated) Definitions of a tag to associate with the resource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--tag))
- `task_auto_retry_attempts` (Number) Maximum automatic retries allowed for a user task.
- `trace_level` (String) Controls how trace events are ingested into the event table. Valid options are: [ALWAYS ON_EVENT OFF]. For information about levels, see [TRACE_LEVEL](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/parameters.html#label-trace-level).
- `user_task_managed_initial_warehouse_size` (String) The initial size of warehouse to use for managed warehouses in the absence of history.
- `user_task_minimum_trigger_interval_in_seconds` (Number) Minimum amount of time between Triggered Task executions in seconds.
- `user_task_timeout_ms` (Number) User task execution timeout in milliseconds.
- `with_managed_access` (Boolean) Specifies a schema as transient. Transient schemas do not have a Fail-safe period so they do not incur additional storage costs once they leave Time Travel; however, this means they are also not protected by Fail-safe in the event of a data loss.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--tag"></a>
### Nested Schema for `tag`

Required:

- `name` (String) Tag name, e.g. department.
- `value` (String) Tag value, e.g. marketing_info.

Optional:

- `database` (String) Name of the database that the tag was created in.
- `schema` (String) Name of the schema that the tag was created in.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# format is dbName | schemaName
terraform import snowflake_schema.example 'dbName|schemaName'
```
