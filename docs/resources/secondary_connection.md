!> **V1 release candidate** This resource is a release candidate for the V1. It is on the list of remaining GA objects for V1. We do not expect significant changes in it before the V1. We will welcome any feedback and adjust the resource if needed. Any errors reported will be resolved with a higher priority. We encourage checking this resource out before the V1 release. Please follow the [migration guide](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md#v0970--v0980) to use it.

# snowflake_secondary_connection (Resource)

Resource used to manage secondary connections. For more information, check [connection documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-connection.html).

## Example Usage

```terraform
## Minimal
resource "snowflake_secondary_connection" "basic" {
  name = "connection_name"
}

## Complete (with every optional set)
resource "snowflake_secondary_connection" "complete" {
  name          = "connection_name"
  as_replica_of = "<organization_name>.<account_name>.<connection_name>"
  comment       = "my complete secondary connection"
}
```
-> **Note** Instead of using fully_qualified_name, you can reference objects managed outside Terraform by constructing a correct ID, consult [identifiers guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Snowflake-Labs/snowflake/latest/docs/guides/identifiers#new-computed-fully-qualified-name-field-in-resources).
<!-- TODO(SNOW-1634854): include an example showing both methods-->

## Schema

### Required

- `as_replica_of` (String) Specifies the identifier for a primary connection from which to create a replica (i.e. a secondary connection).
- `name` (String) String that specifies the identifier (i.e. name) for the connection. Must start with an alphabetic character and may only contain letters, decimal digits (0-9), and underscores (_). For a secondary connection, the name must match the name of its primary connection. Due to technical limitations (read more [here](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/docs/technical-documentation/identifiers_rework_design_decisions.md#known-limitations-and-identifier-recommendations)), avoid using the following characters: `|`, `.`, `(`, `)`, `"`

### Optional

- `comment` (String) Specifies a comment for the secondary connection.

### Read-Only

- `fully_qualified_name` (String) Fully qualified name of the resource. For more information, see [object name resolution](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/name-resolution).
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `show_output` (List of Object) Outputs the result of `SHOW CONNECTIONS` for the given secret. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--show_output))

<a id="nestedatt--show_output"></a>
### Nested Schema for `show_output`

Read-Only:

- `account_locator` (String)
- `account_name` (String)
- `comment` (String)
- `connection_url` (String)
- `created_on` (String)
- `failover_allowed_to_accounts` (List of String)
- `is_primary` (Boolean)

- `organization_name` (String)
- `primary` (String)
- `region_group` (String)
- `snowflake_region` (String)
