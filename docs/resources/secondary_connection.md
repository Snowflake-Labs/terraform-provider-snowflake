!> **V1 release candidate** This resource is a release candidate for the V1. It is on the list of remaining GA objects for V1. We do not expect significant changes in it before the V1. We will welcome any feedback and adjust the resource if needed. Any errors reported will be resolved with a higher priority. We encourage checking this resource out before the V1 release. Please follow the [migration guide](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md#v0970--v0980) to use it.

# snowflake_secondary_connection (Resource)

Resource used to manage secondary (replicated) connections. To manage primary connection check resource [snowflake_primary_connection](./primary_connection). For more information, check [connection documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-connection.html).

## Example Usage

```terraform
## Minimal
resource "snowflake_secondary_connection" "basic" {
  name          = "connection_name"
  as_replica_of = "<organization_name>.<account_name>.<connection_name>"
}

## Complete (with every optional set)
resource "snowflake_secondary_connection" "complete" {
  name          = "connection_name"
  as_replica_of = "<organization_name>.<account_name>.<connection_name>"
  comment       = "my complete secondary connection"
}
```

-> **Note** Instead of using fully_qualified_name, you can reference objects managed outside Terraform by constructing a correct ID, consult [identifiers guide](../guides/identifiers#new-computed-fully-qualified-name-field-in-resources).

-> **Note** To promote `snowflake_secondary_connection` to [`snowflake_primary_connection`](./primary_connection), resources need to be migrated manually. For guidance on removing and importing resources into the state check [resource migration](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/docs/technical-documentation/resource_migration.md). Remove the resource from the state, then promote it manually using:
    ```
    ALTER CONNECTION <name> PRIMARY;
    ```
and then import it as the `snowflake_primary_connection`.

## Schema

### Required

- `as_replica_of` (String) Specifies the identifier for a primary connection from which to create a replica (i.e. a secondary connection).
- `name` (String) String that specifies the identifier (i.e. name) for the connection. Must start with an alphabetic character and may only contain letters, decimal digits (0-9), and underscores (_). For a secondary connection, the name must match the name of its primary connection. Due to technical limitations (read more [here](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/docs/technical-documentation/identifiers_rework_design_decisions.md#known-limitations-and-identifier-recommendations)), avoid using the following characters: `|`, `.`, `"`

### Optional

- `comment` (String) Specifies a comment for the secondary connection.

### Read-Only

- `fully_qualified_name` (String) Fully qualified name of the resource. For more information, see [object name resolution](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/name-resolution).
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `is_primary` (Boolean) Indicates if the connection primary status has been changed. If change is detected, resource will be recreated.
- `show_output` (List of Object) Outputs the result of `SHOW CONNECTIONS` for the given connection. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--show_output))

<a id="nestedatt--show_output"></a>
### Nested Schema for `show_output`

Read-Only:

- `account_locator` (String)
- `account_name` (String)
- `comment` (String)
- `connection_url` (String)
- `created_on` (String)
- `failover_allowed_to_accounts` (List of String)
- `is_primary` (Boolean)
- `name` (String)
- `organization_name` (String)
- `primary` (String)
- `region_group` (String)
- `snowflake_region` (String)

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
terraform import snowflake_secondary_connection.example 'secondary_connection_name'
```
