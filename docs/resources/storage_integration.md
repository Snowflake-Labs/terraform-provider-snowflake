# snowflake_storage_integration (Resource)



## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "snowflake_storage_integration" "integration" {
  name    = "storage"
  comment = "A storage integration."
  type    = "EXTERNAL_STAGE"

  enabled = true

  #   storage_allowed_locations = [""]
  #   storage_blocked_locations = [""]
  #   storage_aws_object_acl    = "bucket-owner-full-control"

  storage_provider         = "S3"
  storage_aws_external_id  = "..."
  storage_aws_iam_user_arn = "..."
  storage_aws_role_arn     = "..."

  # azure_tenant_id
}
```

-> **Note** Instead of using fully_qualified_name, you can reference objects managed outside Terraform by constructing a correct ID, consult [identifiers guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Snowflake-Labs/snowflake/latest/docs/guides/identifiers#new-computed-fully-qualified-name-field-in-resources).
<!-- TODO(SNOW-1634854): include an example showing both methods-->
