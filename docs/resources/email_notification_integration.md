# snowflake_email_notification_integration (Resource)



## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "snowflake_email_notification_integration" "email_int" {
  name    = "notification"
  comment = "A notification integration."

  enabled            = true
  allowed_recipients = ["john.doe@gmail.com"]
}
```

-> **Note** Instead of using fully_qualified_name, you can reference objects managed outside Terraform by constructing a correct ID, consult [identifiers guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Snowflake-Labs/snowflake/latest/docs/guides/identifiers#new-computed-fully-qualified-name-field-in-resources).
<!-- TODO(SNOW-1634854): include an example showing both methods-->
