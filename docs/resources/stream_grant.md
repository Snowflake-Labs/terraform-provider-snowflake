# snowflake_stream_grant (Resource)



## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "snowflake_stream_grant" "grant" {
  database_name = "database"
  schema_name   = "schema"
  stream_name   = "view"

  privilege = "SELECT"
  roles     = ["role1", "role2"]

  on_future         = false
  with_grant_option = false
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `database_name` (String) The name of the database containing the current or future streams on which to grant privileges.
- `roles` (Set of String) Grants privilege to these roles.

### Optional

- `enable_multiple_grants` (Boolean) When this is set to true, multiple grants of the same type can be created. This will cause Terraform to not revoke grants applied to roles and objects outside Terraform.
- `on_all` (Boolean) When this is set to true and a schema_name is provided, apply this grant on all streams in the given schema. When this is true and no schema_name is provided apply this grant on all streams in the given database. The stream_name field must be unset in order to use on_all. Cannot be used together with on_future.
- `on_future` (Boolean) When this is set to true and a schema_name is provided, apply this grant on all future streams in the given schema. When this is true and no schema_name is provided apply this grant on all future streams in the given database. The stream_name field must be unset in order to use on_future. Cannot be used together with on_all.
- `privilege` (String) The privilege to grant on the current or future stream. To grant all privileges, use the value `ALL PRIVILEGES`.
- `revert_ownership_to_role_name` (String) The name of the role to revert ownership to on destroy. Has no effect unless `privilege` is set to `OWNERSHIP`
- `schema_name` (String) The name of the schema containing the current or future streams on which to grant privileges.
- `stream_name` (String) The name of the stream on which to grant privileges immediately (only valid if on_future is false).
- `with_grant_option` (Boolean) When this is set to true, allows the recipient role to grant the privileges to other roles.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# format is database_name|schema_name|stream_name|privilege|with_grant_option|on_future|roles"
terraform import snowflake_stream_grant.example "MY_DATABASE|MY_SCHEMA|MY_STREAM|SELECT|false|false|role1,role2"
```
