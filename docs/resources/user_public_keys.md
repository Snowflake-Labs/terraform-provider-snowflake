# snowflake_user_public_keys (Resource)

This resource helps manage a user's public keys. Use this resource only when the user resources are created/managed through a mechanism external to Terraform (such as SCIM).

Note that this provider won't know when a user's public keys were changed through an external mechanism. It currently only knows to write updates to Snowflake but doesn't know how to synchronize updates from Snowflake.
