  The resource is used for role management, where roles can be assigned privileges and, in turn, granted to users and other roles. When granted to roles they can create hierarchies of privilege structures.

# snowflake_account_role (Resource)

The resource is used for role management, where roles can be assigned privileges and, in turn, granted to users and other roles. When granted to roles they can create hierarchies of privilege structures. For more details, refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/security-access-control-overview).

## Example Usage

```terraform
## Minimal
resource "snowflake_account_role" "minimal" {
  name = "role_name"
}

## Complete (with every optional set)
resource "snowflake_account_role" "complete" {
  name    = "role_name"
  comment = "my account role"
}
```
-> **Note** Instead of using fully_qualified_name, you can reference objects managed outside Terraform by constructing a correct ID, consult [identifiers guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Snowflake-Labs/snowflake/latest/docs/guides/identifiers#new-computed-fully-qualified-name-field-in-resources).
<!-- TODO(SNOW-1634854): include an example showing both methods-->
