# snowflake_row_access_policy_grant (Resource)



## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "snowflake_row_access_policy_grant" "grant" {
  database_name          = "database"
  schema_name            = "schema"
  row_access_policy_name = "row_access_policy"

```

## Schema

### Required

- `database_name` (String) The name of the database containing the row access policy on which to grant privileges.
- `row_access_policy_name` (String) The name of the row access policy on which to grant privileges immediately.
- `schema_name` (String) The name of the schema containing the row access policy on which to grant privileges.

### Optional

- `enable_multiple_grants` (Boolean) When this is set to true, multiple grants of the same type can be created. This will cause Terraform to not revoke grants applied to roles and objects outside Terraform.
- `privilege` (String) The privilege to grant on the row access policy.
- `roles` (Set of String) Grants privilege to these roles.
- `with_grant_option` (Boolean) When this is set to true, allows the recipient role to grant the privileges to other roles.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# format is database_name | schema_name | object_name | privilege | with_grant_option | roles
terraform import snowflake_row_access_policy_grant.example 'MY_DATABASE|MY_SCHEMA|MY_OBJECT_NAME|SELECT|false|role1,role2'
```
