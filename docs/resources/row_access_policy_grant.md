# snowflake_row_access_policy_grant (Resource)

~> **Deprecation** This resource is deprecated and will be removed in a future major version release. Please use [snowflake_grant_privileges_to_account_role](./grant_privileges_to_account_role) instead. <deprecation>

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "snowflake_row_access_policy_grant" "grant" {
  database_name          = "database"
  schema_name            = "schema"
  row_access_policy_name = "row_access_policy"

  privilege = "APPLY"
  roles     = ["role1", "role2"]

  with_grant_option = false
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `database_name` (String) The name of the database containing the row access policy on which to grant privileges.
- `row_access_policy_name` (String) The name of the row access policy on which to grant privileges immediately.
- `schema_name` (String) The name of the schema containing the row access policy on which to grant privileges.

### Optional

- `enable_multiple_grants` (Boolean) When this is set to true, multiple grants of the same type can be created. This will cause Terraform to not revoke grants applied to roles and objects outside Terraform.
- `privilege` (String) The privilege to grant on the row access policy. To grant all privileges, use the value `ALL PRIVILEGES`
- `revert_ownership_to_role_name` (String) The name of the role to revert ownership to on destroy. Has no effect unless `privilege` is set to `OWNERSHIP`
- `roles` (Set of String) Grants privilege to these roles.
- `with_grant_option` (Boolean) When this is set to true, allows the recipient role to grant the privileges to other roles.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# format is database_name|schema_name|row_access_policy_name|privilege|with_grant_option|roles
terraform import snowflake_row_access_policy_grant.example "MY_DATABASE|MY_SCHEMA|MY_ROW_ACCESS_POLICY_NAME|SELECT|false|role1,role2"
```
