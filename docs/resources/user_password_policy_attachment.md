!> **Caution: Preview Feature** This feature is considered a preview feature in the provider, regardless of the state of the resource in Snowflake. We do not guarantee its stability. It will be reworked and marked as a stable feature in future releases. Breaking changes are expected, even without bumping the major version. To use this feature, add the relevant feature name to `preview_features_enabled field` in the [provider configuration](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Snowflake-Labs/snowflake/latest/docs#schema). Please always refer to the [Getting Help](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/terraform-provider-snowflake?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-help) section in our Github repo to best determine how to get help for your questions.

# snowflake_user_password_policy_attachment (Resource)

Specifies the password policy to use for a certain user.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "snowflake_user" "user" {
  name = "USER_NAME"
}
resource "snowflake_password_policy" "pp" {
  database = "prod"
  schema   = "security"
  name     = "default_policy"
}

resource "snowflake_user_password_policy_attachment" "ppa" {
  password_policy_name = snowflake_password_policy.pp.fully_qualified_name
  user_name            = snowflake_user.user.name
}
```

-> **Note** Instead of using fully_qualified_name, you can reference objects managed outside Terraform by constructing a correct ID, consult [identifiers guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Snowflake-Labs/snowflake/latest/docs/guides/identifiers#new-computed-fully-qualified-name-field-in-resources).
<!-- TODO(SNOW-1634854): include an example showing both methods-->
