# snowflake_managed_account (Resource)



## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "snowflake_managed_account" "account" {
  name           = "managed account"
  admin_name     = "admin"
  admin_password = "secret"
  type           = "READER"
  comment        = "A managed account."
  cloud          = "aws"
  region         = "us-west-2"
  locator        = "managed-account"
}
```

-> **Note** Instead of using fully_qualified_name, you can reference objects managed outside Terraform by constructing a correct ID, consult [identifiers guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Snowflake-Labs/snowflake/latest/docs/guides/identifiers#new-computed-fully-qualified-name-field-in-resources).
<!-- TODO(SNOW-1634854): include an example showing both methods-->
