## Example Usage

```terraform
resource snowflake_view_grant grant {
  database_name           = "db"
  schema_name             = "schema"
  materialized_view_name  = "materialized_view"

  privilege = "select"
  roles = [
    "role1",
    "role2",
  ]

  shares = [
    "share1",
    "share2",
  ]

  on_future         = false

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# format is database name | schema name | materialized view name | privilege | true/false for with_grant_option
terraform import snowflake_materialized_view_grant.example 'dbName|schemaName|materializedViewName|SELECT|false'
```
