We will welcome any feedback and adjust the resource if needed. Any errors reported will be resolved with a higher priority. We encourage checking this resource out before the V1 release.

## Example Usage

```terraform
locals {

}

##################################

##################################


resource "snowflake_account_role" "role" {
  name = "my_role"
}

resource "snowflake_grant_application_role" "g" {
  application_role_name    = local.application_role_identifier
  parent_account_role_name = snowflake_account_role.role.name
}

##################################

-> **Note** Instead of using fully_qualified_name, you can reference objects managed outside Terraform by constructing a correct ID, consult [identifiers guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Snowflake-Labs/snowflake/latest/docs/guides/identifiers#new-computed-fully-qualified-name-field-in-resources).
