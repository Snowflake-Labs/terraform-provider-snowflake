!> **V1 release candidate** This resource was reworked and is a release candidate for the V1. We do not expect significant changes in it before the V1. We will welcome any feedback and adjust the resource if needed. Any errors reported will be resolved with a higher priority. We encourage checking this resource out before the V1 release. To migrate from older grant resources please follow the [migration guide](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md#migration-from-old-grant-resources-to-new-ones).

# snowflake_grant_account_role (Resource)



## Example Usage

```terraform
##################################
### grant account role to account role
##################################

resource "snowflake_account_role" "role" {
  name = var.role_name
}

resource "snowflake_account_role" "parent_role" {
  name = var.parent_role_name
}

resource "snowflake_grant_account_role" "g" {
  role_name        = snowflake_account_role.role.name
  parent_role_name = snowflake_account_role.parent_role.name
}


##################################
### grant account role to user
##################################

resource "snowflake_account_role" "role" {
  name = var.role_name
}

resource "snowflake_user" "user" {
  name = var.user_name
}

resource "snowflake_grant_account_role" "g" {
  role_name = snowflake_account_role.role.name
  user_name = snowflake_user.user.name
}
```

-> **Note** Instead of using fully_qualified_name, you can reference objects managed outside Terraform by constructing a correct ID, consult [identifiers guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Snowflake-Labs/snowflake/latest/docs/guides/identifiers#new-computed-fully-qualified-name-field-in-resources).
