# snowflake_share (Resource)



## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "snowflake_share" "test" {
  name     = "share_name"
  comment  = "cool comment"
  accounts = ["organizationName.accountName"]
}

resource "snowflake_database" "example" {
  # remember to define dependency between objects on a share, because shared objects have to be dropped before dropping share
  depends_on = [snowflake_share.test]
  name       = "test"
}
```

-> **Note** If you don't manage referenced objects in Terraform, you can construct the proper id yourself, consult [identifiers guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Snowflake-Labs/snowflake/latest/docs/guides/identifiers#new-computed-fully-qualified-name-field-in-resources)
<!-- TODO(SNOW-1634854): include an example showing both methods-->
