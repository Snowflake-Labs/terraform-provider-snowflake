# snowflake_execute (Resource)

!> **Warning** This is a dangerous resource that allows executing **ANY** SQL statement. It may destroy resources if used incorrectly. It may behave incorrectly combined with other resources. Use at your own risk.

~> **Note** It can be theoretically used to manage resource that are not supported by the provider. This is risky and may brake other resources if used incorrectly.

~> **Note** Use `query` parameter with caution. It will fetch **ALL** the results returned by the query provided. Try to limit the number of results by writing query with filters. Query failure does not stop resource creation; it simply results in `query_results` being empty.

Resource allowing execution of ANY SQL statement.

## Example Usage

```terraform
##################################
### simple use cases
##################################

# create and destroy resource
resource "snowflake_execute" "test" {
  execute = "CREATE DATABASE ABC"
  revert  = "DROP DATABASE ABC"
}

# create and destroy resource using qualified name
resource "snowflake_execute" "test" {
  execute = "CREATE DATABASE \"abc\""
  revert  = "DROP DATABASE \"abc\""
}

# with query
resource "snowflake_execute" "test" {
  execute = "CREATE DATABASE ABC"
  revert  = "DROP DATABASE ABC"
  query   = "SHOW DATABASES LIKE '%ABC%'"
}

##################################
### grants example
##################################

# grant and revoke privilege USAGE to ROLE on database
resource "snowflake_execute" "test" {
  execute = "GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE ABC TO ROLE XYZ"
  revert  = "REVOKE USAGE ON DATABASE ABC FROM ROLE XYZ"
}

# grant and revoke with for_each
variable "database_grants" {
  type = list(object({
    database_name = string
    role_id       = string
    privileges    = list(string)
  }))
}

resource "snowflake_execute" "test" {
  for_each = { for index, db_grant in var.database_grants : index => db_grant }
  execute  = "GRANT ${join(",", each.value.privileges)} ON DATABASE ${each.value.database_name} TO ROLE ${each.value.role_id}"
  revert   = "REVOKE ${join(",", each.value.privileges)} ON DATABASE ${each.value.database_name} FROM ROLE ${each.value.role_id}"
}

##################################
### fixing bad configuration
##################################

# bad revert
# 1 - resource created with a bad revert; it is constructed, revert is not validated before destroy happens
resource "snowflake_execute" "test" {
  execute = "CREATE DATABASE ABC"
  revert  = "SELECT 1"
}

# 2 - fix the revert first; resource won't be recreated
resource "snowflake_execute" "test" {
  execute = "CREATE DATABASE ABC"
  revert  = "DROP DATABASE ABC"
}

# bad query
# 1 - resource will be created; query_results will be empty
resource "snowflake_execute" "test" {
  execute = "CREATE DATABASE ABC"
  revert  = "DROP DATABASE ABC"
  query   = "bad query"
}

# 2 - fix the query; query_results will be calculated; resource won't be recreated
resource "snowflake_execute" "test" {
  execute = "CREATE DATABASE ABC"
  revert  = "DROP DATABASE ABC"
  query   = "SHOW DATABASES LIKE '%ABC%'"
}
```
-> **Note** Instead of using fully_qualified_name, you can reference objects managed outside Terraform by constructing a correct ID, consult [identifiers guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Snowflake-Labs/snowflake/latest/docs/guides/identifiers#new-computed-fully-qualified-name-field-in-resources).

## Schema

### Required

- `execute` (String) SQL statement to execute. Forces recreation of resource on change.
- `revert` (String) SQL statement to revert the execute statement. Invoked when resource is being destroyed.

### Optional

- `query` (String) Optional SQL statement to do a read. Invoked on every resource refresh and every time it is changed.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `query_results` (List of Map of String) List of key-value maps (text to text) retrieved after executing read query. Will be empty if the query results in an error.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
terraform import snowflake_execute.example '<random_uuid>'
```
