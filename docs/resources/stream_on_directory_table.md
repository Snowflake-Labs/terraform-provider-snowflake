subcategory: "Stable"
description: |-
  Resource used to manage streams on directory tables. For more information, check stream documentation https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-stream.
---

~> **Note about copy_grants** Fields like `stage`, and `stale` can not be ALTERed on Snowflake side (check [docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/alter-stream)), and a change on these fields means recreation of the resource. ForceNew can not be used because it does not preserve grants from `copy_grants`. Beware that even though a change is marked as update, the resource is recreated.

# snowflake_stream_on_directory_table (Resource)

Resource used to manage streams on directory tables. For more information, check [stream documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-stream).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# basic resource
resource "snowflake_stream_on_directory_table" "stream" {
  name     = "stream"
  schema   = "schema"
  database = "database"

  stage = snowflake_stage.example.fully_qualified_name
}


# resource with more fields set
resource "snowflake_stream_on_directory_table" "stream" {
  name     = "stream"
  schema   = "schema"
  database = "database"

  copy_grants = true
  stage       = snowflake_stage.example.fully_qualified_name

  comment = "A stream."
}
```
-> **Note** Instead of using fully_qualified_name, you can reference objects managed outside Terraform by constructing a correct ID, consult [identifiers guide](../guides/identifiers_rework_design_decisions#new-computed-fully-qualified-name-field-in-resources).
<!-- TODO(SNOW-1634854): include an example showing both methods-->

## Schema

### Required

- `database` (String) The database in which to create the stream. Due to technical limitations (read more [here](../guides/identifiers_rework_design_decisions#known-limitations-and-identifier-recommendations)), avoid using the following characters: `|`, `.`, `"`.
- `name` (String) Specifies the identifier for the stream; must be unique for the database and schema in which the stream is created. Due to technical limitations (read more [here](../guides/identifiers_rework_design_decisions#known-limitations-and-identifier-recommendations)), avoid using the following characters: `|`, `.`, `"`.
- `schema` (String) The schema in which to create the stream. Due to technical limitations (read more [here](../guides/identifiers_rework_design_decisions#known-limitations-and-identifier-recommendations)), avoid using the following characters: `|`, `.`, `"`.
- `stage` (String) Specifies an identifier for the stage the stream will monitor. Due to Snowflake limitations, the provider can not read the stage's database and schema. For stages, Snowflake returns only partially qualified name instead of fully qualified name. Please use stages located in the same schema as the stream. Due to technical limitations (read more [here](../guides/identifiers_rework_design_decisions#known-limitations-and-identifier-recommendations)), avoid using the following characters: `|`, `.`, `"`. For more information about this resource, see [docs](./stage).

### Optional

- `comment` (String) Specifies a comment for the stream.
- `copy_grants` (Boolean) Retains the access permissions from the original stream when a stream is recreated using the OR REPLACE clause. This is used when the provider detects changes for fields that can not be changed by ALTER. This value will not have any effect during creating a new object with Terraform.

### Read-Only

- `describe_output` (List of Object) Outputs the result of `DESCRIBE STREAM` for the given stream. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--describe_output))
- `fully_qualified_name` (String) Fully qualified name of the resource. For more information, see [object name resolution](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/name-resolution).
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `show_output` (List of Object) Outputs the result of `SHOW STREAMS` for the given stream. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--show_output))
- `stale` (Boolean) Indicated if the stream is stale. When Terraform detects that the stream is stale, the stream is recreated with `CREATE OR REPLACE`. Read more on stream staleness in Snowflake [docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/streams-intro#data-retention-period-and-staleness).
- `stream_type` (String) Specifies a type for the stream. This field is used for checking external changes and recreating the resources if needed.
