!> **Caution: Preview Feature** This feature is considered a preview feature in the provider, regardless of the state of the resource in Snowflake. We do not guarantee its stability. It will be reworked and marked as a stable feature in future releases. Breaking changes are expected, even without bumping the major version. To use this feature, add the relevant feature name to `preview_features_enabled field` in the [provider configuration](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Snowflake-Labs/snowflake/latest/docs#schema). Please always refer to the [Getting Help](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/terraform-provider-snowflake?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-help) section in our Github repo to best determine how to get help for your questions.

# snowflake_cortex_search_service (Resource)



## Example Usage

```terraform
## Basic
resource "snowflake_database" "test" {
  name = "some_database"
}

resource "snowflake_schema" "test" {
  database = snowflake_database.test.name
  name     = "some_schema"
}

resource "snowflake_table" "test" {
  database        = snowflake_database.test.name
  schema          = snowflake_schema.test.name
  name            = "some_table"
  change_tracking = true
  column {
    name = "ID"
    type = "NUMBER(38,0)"
  }

  column {
    name = "SOME_TEXT"
    type = "VARCHAR"
  }
}

resource "snowflake_cortex_search_service" "test" {
  depends_on = [snowflake_table.test]

  database   = snowflake_database.test.name
  schema     = snowflake_schema.test.name
  name       = "some_name"
  on         = "SOME_TEXT"
  target_lag = "2 minutes"
  warehouse  = "some_warehouse"
  query      = "SELECT SOME_TEXT FROM \"some_database\".\"some_schema\".\"some_table\""
  comment    = "some comment"
}
```
-> **Note** Instead of using fully_qualified_name, you can reference objects managed outside Terraform by constructing a correct ID, consult [identifiers guide](../guides/identifiers_rework_design_decisions#new-computed-fully-qualified-name-field-in-resources).
