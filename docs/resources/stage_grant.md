## Example Usage

```terraform
resource snowflake_stage_grant grant {
  database_name = "db"
  schema_name   = "schema"
  stage_name    = "stage"

  privilege = "USAGE"

  roles  = ["role1", "role2"]
  shares = ["share1", "share2"]

  on_future         = false
  with_grant_option = false
}
```

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# format is database name | schema name | stage name | privilege | true/false for with_grant_option
terraform import snowflake_stage_grant.example 'databaseName|schemaName|stageName|USAGE|true'
```
