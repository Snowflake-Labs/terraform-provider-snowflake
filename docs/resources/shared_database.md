# snowflake_shared_database (Resource)





<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `from_share` (String) A fully qualified path to a share from which the database will be created. A fully qualified path follows the format of `"<organization_name>"."<account_name>"."<share_name>"`.
- `name` (String) Specifies the identifier for the database; must be unique for your account.

### Optional

- `catalog` (String) The database parameter that specifies the default catalog to use for Iceberg tables.
- `comment` (String) Specifies a comment for the database.
- `default_ddl_collation` (String) Specifies a default collation specification for all schemas and tables added to the database. It can be overridden on schema or table level. For more information, see [collation specification](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/collation#label-collation-specification).
- `external_volume` (String) The database parameter that specifies the default external volume to use for Iceberg tables.
- `is_transient` (Boolean) Specifies the database as transient. Transient databases do not have a Fail-safe period so they do not incur additional storage costs once they leave Time Travel; however, this means they are also not protected by Fail-safe in the event of a data loss.
- `log_level` (String) Specifies the severity level of messages that should be ingested and made available in the active event table. Valid options are: [TRACE DEBUG INFO WARN ERROR FATAL OFF]. Messages at the specified level (and at more severe levels) are ingested. For more information, see [LOG_LEVEL](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/parameters.html#label-log-level).
- `trace_level` (String) Controls how trace events are ingested into the event table. Valid options are: [ALWAYS ON_EVENT OFF]. For information about levels, see [TRACE_LEVEL](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/parameters.html#label-trace-level).

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
