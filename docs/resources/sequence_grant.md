# snowflake_sequence_grant (Resource)



## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "snowflake_sequence_grant" "grant" {
  database_name = "database"
  schema_name   = "schema"
  sequence_name = "sequence"

  privilege = "SELECT"
  roles     = ["role1", "role2"]

  on_future         = false
  with_grant_option = false
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `database_name` (String) The name of the database containing the current or future sequences on which to grant privileges.
- `roles` (Set of String) Grants privilege to these roles.

### Optional

- `enable_multiple_grants` (Boolean) When this is set to true, multiple grants of the same type can be created. This will cause Terraform to not revoke grants applied to roles and objects outside Terraform.
- `on_future` (Boolean) When this is set to true and a schema_name is provided, apply this grant on all future sequences in the given schema. When this is true and no schema_name is provided apply this grant on all future sequences in the given database. The sequence_name field must be unset in order to use on_future.
- `privilege` (String) The privilege to grant on the current or future sequence.
- `schema_name` (String) The name of the schema containing the current or future sequences on which to grant privileges.
- `sequence_name` (String) The name of the sequence on which to grant privileges immediately (only valid if on_future is false).
- `with_grant_option` (Boolean) When this is set to true, allows the recipient role to grant the privileges to other roles.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# format is database_name | schema_name | sequence_name | privilege | with_grant_option | roles
terraform import snowflake_schema_grant.example 'MY_DATABASE|MY_SCHEMA|MY_OBJECT|USAGE|false|role1,role2'
```
