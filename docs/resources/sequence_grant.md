# snowflake_sequence_grant (Resource)



## Example Usage

```terraform
resource snowflake_sequence_grant grant {
  database_name = "db"
  schema_name   = "schema"
  sequence_name = "sequence"

  privilege = "select"
  roles = [
    "role1",
    "role2",
  ]

  on_future         = false
  with_grant_option = false
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- **database_name** (String) The name of the database containing the current or future sequences on which to grant privileges.
- **schema_name** (String) The name of the schema containing the current or future sequences on which to grant privileges.

### Optional

- **enable_multiple_grants** (Boolean) When this is set to true, multiple grants of the same type can be created. This will cause Terraform to not revoke grants applied to roles and objects outside Terraform.
- **id** (String) The ID of this resource.
- **on_future** (Boolean) When this is set to true and a schema_name is provided, apply this grant on all future sequences in the given schema. When this is true and no schema_name is provided apply this grant on all future sequences in the given database. The sequence_name field must be unset in order to use on_future.
- **privilege** (String) The privilege to grant on the current or future sequence.
- **roles** (Set of String) Grants privilege to these roles.
- **sequence_name** (String) The name of the sequence on which to grant privileges immediately (only valid if on_future is false).
- **with_grant_option** (Boolean) When this is set to true, allows the recipient role to grant the privileges to other roles.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# format is database name | schema name | sequence name | privilege | true/false for with_grant_option
terraform import snowflake_sequence_grant.example 'dbName|schemaName|sequenceName|USAGE|false'
```
