# snowflake_stream (Resource)



## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "snowflake_table" "table" {
  database = "database"
  schema   = "schema"
  name     = "name"

  column {
    type = "NUMBER(38,0)"
    name = "id"
  }
}

resource "snowflake_stream" "stream" {
  comment = "A stream."

  database = "database"
  schema   = "schema"
  name     = "stream"

  on_table    = snowflake_table.table.fully_qualified_name
  append_only = false
  insert_only = false

  owner = "role1"
}
```

-> **Note** If you don't manage referenced objects in Terraform, you can construct the proper id yourself, consult [identifiers guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Snowflake-Labs/snowflake/latest/docs/guides/identifiers#new-computed-fully-qualified-name-field-in-resources)
