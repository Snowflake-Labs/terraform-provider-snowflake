# snowflake_view_grant (Resource)

~> **Deprecation** This resource is deprecated and will be removed in a future major version release. Please use [snowflake_grant_privileges_to_account_role](./grant_privileges_to_account_role) instead. <deprecation>

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "snowflake_view_grant" "grant" {
  database_name = "database"
  schema_name   = "schema"
  view_name     = "view"

  privilege = "SELECT"
  roles     = ["role1", "role2"]

  shares = ["share1", "share2"]

  on_future         = false
  with_grant_option = false
}

/*
Snowflake view grant is an object level grant, not a schema level grant. To add schema level
grants, use the `snowflake_schema_grant` resource
*/

resource "snowflake_schema_grant" "grant" {
  database_name = "database"
  schema_name   = "schema"

  privilege = "USAGE"
  roles     = ["role1", "role2"]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `database_name` (String) The name of the database containing the current or future views on which to grant privileges.

### Optional

- `enable_multiple_grants` (Boolean) When this is set to true, multiple grants of the same type can be created. This will cause Terraform to not revoke grants applied to roles and objects outside Terraform.
- `on_all` (Boolean) When this is set to true and a schema_name is provided, apply this grant on all views in the given schema. When this is true and no schema_name is provided apply this grant on all views in the given database. The view_name and shares fields must be unset in order to use on_all. Cannot be used together with on_future.
- `on_future` (Boolean) When this is set to true and a schema_name is provided, apply this grant on all future views in the given schema. When this is true and no schema_name is provided apply this grant on all future views in the given database. The view_name and shares fields must be unset in order to use on_future. Cannot be used together with on_all.
- `privilege` (String) The privilege to grant on the current or future view. To grant all privileges, use the value `ALL PRIVILEGES`.
- `revert_ownership_to_role_name` (String) The name of the role to revert ownership to on destroy. Has no effect unless `privilege` is set to `OWNERSHIP`
- `roles` (Set of String) Grants privilege to these roles.
- `schema_name` (String) The name of the schema containing the current or future views on which to grant privileges.
- `shares` (Set of String) Grants privilege to these shares (only valid if on_future and on_all are unset).
- `view_name` (String) The name of the view on which to grant privileges immediately (only valid if on_future and on_all are unset).
- `with_grant_option` (Boolean) When this is set to true, allows the recipient role to grant the privileges to other roles.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
