# snowflake_task (Resource)



## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "snowflake_task" "task" {
  comment = "my task"

  database  = "database"
  schema    = "schema"
  warehouse = "warehouse"

  name          = "task"
  schedule      = "10 MINUTE"
  sql_statement = "select * from foo;"

  session_parameters = {
    "foo" : "bar",
  }

  user_task_timeout_ms = 10000
  after                = "preceding_task"
  when                 = "foo AND bar"
  enabled              = true
}

resource "snowflake_task" "serverless_task" {
  comment = "my serverless task"

  database = "db"
  schema   = "schema"

  name          = "serverless_task"
  schedule      = "10 MINUTE"
  sql_statement = "select * from foo;"

  session_parameters = {
    "foo" : "bar",
  }

  user_task_timeout_ms                     = 10000
  user_task_managed_initial_warehouse_size = "XSMALL"
  after                                    = [snowflake_task.task.name]
  when                                     = "foo AND bar"
  enabled                                  = true
}

resource "snowflake_task" "test_task" {
  comment = "task with allow_overlapping_execution"

  database = "database"
  schema   = "schema"

  name          = "test_task"
  sql_statement = "select 1 as c;"

  allow_overlapping_execution = true
  enabled                     = true
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `database` (String) The database in which to create the task.
- `name` (String) Specifies the identifier for the task; must be unique for the database and schema in which the task is created.
- `schema` (String) The schema in which to create the task.
- `sql_statement` (String) Any single SQL statement, or a call to a stored procedure, executed when the task runs.

### Optional

- `after` (List of String) Specifies one or more predecessor tasks for the current task. Use this option to create a DAG of tasks or add this task to an existing DAG. A DAG is a series of tasks that starts with a scheduled root task and is linked together by dependencies.
- `allow_overlapping_execution` (Boolean) By default, Snowflake ensures that only one instance of a particular DAG is allowed to run at a time, setting the parameter value to TRUE permits DAG runs to overlap.
- `comment` (String) Specifies a comment for the task.
- `enabled` (Boolean) Specifies if the task should be started (enabled) after creation or should remain suspended (default).
- `error_integration` (String) Specifies the name of the notification integration used for error notifications.
- `schedule` (String) The schedule for periodically running the task. This can be a cron or interval in minutes. (Conflict with after)
- `session_parameters` (Map of String) Specifies session parameters to set for the session when the task runs. A task supports all session parameters.
- `suspend_task_after_num_failures` (Number) Specifies the number of consecutive failed task runs after which the current task is suspended automatically. The default is 0 (no automatic suspension).
- `user_task_managed_initial_warehouse_size` (String) Specifies the size of the compute resources to provision for the first run of the task, before a task history is available for Snowflake to determine an ideal size. Once a task has successfully completed a few runs, Snowflake ignores this parameter setting. (Conflicts with warehouse)
- `user_task_timeout_ms` (Number) Specifies the time limit on a single run of the task before it times out (in milliseconds).
- `warehouse` (String) The warehouse the task will use. Omit this parameter to use Snowflake-managed compute resources for runs of this task. (Conflicts with user_task_managed_initial_warehouse_size)
- `when` (String) Specifies a Boolean SQL expression; multiple conditions joined with AND/OR are supported.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# format is database name | schema name | task name
terraform import snowflake_task.example 'dbName|schemaName|taskName'
```
