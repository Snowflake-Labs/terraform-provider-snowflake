# snowflake_task (Resource)



## Example Usage

```terraform
resource snowflake_task task {
  comment = "my task"

  database  = "db"
  schema    = "schema"
  warehouse = "warehouse"

  name          = "task"
  schedule      = "10 MINUTE"
  sql_statement = "select * from foo;"

  session_parameters = {
    "foo" : "bar",
  }

  user_task_timeout_ms = 10000
  after                = "preceding_task"
  when                 = "foo AND bar"
  enabled              = true
}

resource snowflake_task serverless_task {
  comment = "my serverless task"

  database = "db"
  schema   = "schema"

  name          = "serverless_task"
  schedule      = "10 MINUTE"
  sql_statement = "select * from foo;"

  session_parameters = {
    "foo" : "bar",
  }

  user_task_timeout_ms                     = 10000
  user_task_managed_initial_warehouse_size = "XSMALL"
  after                                    = "preceding_task"
  when                                     = "foo AND bar"
  enabled                                  = true
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- **database** (String) The database in which to create the task.
- **name** (String) Specifies the identifier for the task; must be unique for the database and schema in which the task is created.
- **schema** (String) The schema in which to create the task.
- **sql_statement** (String) Any single SQL statement, or a call to a stored procedure, executed when the task runs.

### Optional

- **after** (String) Specifies the predecessor task in the same database and schema of the current task. When a run of the predecessor task finishes successfully, it triggers this task (after a brief lag). (Conflict with schedule)
- **comment** (String) Specifies a comment for the task.
- **enabled** (Boolean) Specifies if the task should be started (enabled) after creation or should remain suspended (default).
- **error_integration** (String) Specifies the name of the notification integration used for error notifications.
- **id** (String) The ID of this resource.
- **schedule** (String) The schedule for periodically running the task. This can be a cron or interval in minutes. (Conflict with after)
- **session_parameters** (Map of String) Specifies session parameters to set for the session when the task runs. A task supports all session parameters.
- **user_task_managed_initial_warehouse_size** (String) Specifies the size of the compute resources to provision for the first run of the task, before a task history is available for Snowflake to determine an ideal size. Once a task has successfully completed a few runs, Snowflake ignores this parameter setting. (Conflicts with warehouse)
- **user_task_timeout_ms** (Number) Specifies the time limit on a single run of the task before it times out (in milliseconds).
- **warehouse** (String) The warehouse the task will use. Omit this parameter to use Snowflake-managed compute resources for runs of this task. (Conflicts with user_task_managed_initial_warehouse_size)
- **when** (String) Specifies a Boolean SQL expression; multiple conditions joined with AND/OR are supported.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# format is database name | schema name | task name
terraform import snowflake_task.example 'dbName|schemaName|taskName'
```
