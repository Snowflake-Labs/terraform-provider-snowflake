!> **V1 release candidate** This resource is a release candidate for the V1. It is on the list of remaining GA objects for V1. We do not expect significant changes in it before the V1. We will welcome any feedback and adjust the resource if needed. Any errors reported will be resolved with a higher priority. We encourage checking this resource out before the V1 release. Please follow the [migration guide](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md#v0970--v0980) to use it.

# snowflake_connection (Resource)

Resource used to manage connections. For more information, check [connection documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-connection.html).

## Example Usage

```terraform
## Minimal
resource "snowflake_connection" "basic" {
  name = "connection_name"
}

## Enable failover to accounts
resource "snowflake_connection" "with_enable_failover_list" {
  name = "connection_name"
  enable_failover_to_accounts = [
    "<secondary_account_organization_name>.<secondary_account_name>"
  ]
}

## As replica
resource "snowflake_connection" "replica" {
  name          = "connection_name"
  as_replica_of = "<organization_name>.<account_name>.<connection_name>"
}

# As replica with promotion to primary
resource "snowflake_connection" "replica_with_promotion" {
  name          = "connection_name"
  as_replica_of = "<organization_name>.<account_name>.<connection_name>"
  is_primary    = true
}

## Complete (with every optional set)
resource "snowflake_connection" "complete" {
  name          = "connection_name"
  as_replica_of = "<organization_name>.<account_name>.<connection_name>"
  is_primary    = true
  enable_failover_to_accounts = [
    "<secondary_account_organization_name>.<secondary_account_name>"
  ]
  comment = "my complete connection"
}
```
-> **Note** Instead of using fully_qualified_name, you can reference objects managed outside Terraform by constructing a correct ID, consult [identifiers guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Snowflake-Labs/snowflake/latest/docs/guides/identifiers#new-computed-fully-qualified-name-field-in-resources).
<!-- TODO(SNOW-1634854): include an example showing both methods-->

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) String that specifies the identifier (i.e. name) for the connection. Must start with an alphabetic character and may only contain letters, decimal digits (0-9), and underscores (_). For a primary connection, the name must be unique across connection names and account names in the organization. For a secondary connection, the name must match the name of its primary connection. Due to technical limitations (read more [here](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/docs/technical-documentation/identifiers_rework_design_decisions.md#known-limitations-and-identifier-recommendations)), avoid using the following characters: `|`, `.`, `(`, `)`, `"`

### Optional

- `as_replica_of` (String) Specifies the identifier for a primary connection from which to create a replica (i.e. a secondary connection).
- `comment` (String) Specifies a comment for the connection.
- `enable_failover_to_accounts` (List of String) Enables failover for given connection to provided accounts. Specifies a list of accounts in your organization where a secondary connection for this primary connection can be promoted to serve as the primary connection. Include your organization name for each account in the list.
- `is_primary` (Boolean)

### Read-Only

- `fully_qualified_name` (String) Fully qualified name of the resource. For more information, see [object name resolution](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/name-resolution).
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `show_output` (List of Object) Outputs the result of `SHOW CONNECTIONS` for the given secret. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--show_output))

<a id="nestedatt--show_output"></a>
### Nested Schema for `show_output`

Read-Only:

- `account_locator` (String)
- `account_name` (String)
- `comment` (String)
- `connection_url` (String)
- `created_on` (String)
- `failover_allowed_to_accounts` (List of String)
- `is_primary` (Boolean)
- `name` (String)
- `organization_name` (String)
- `primary` (String)
- `region_group` (String)
- `snowflake_region` (String)
