# Snowflake Provider

~> **Disclaimer** the project is still in the 0.x.x version, which means itâ€™s still in the experimental phase (check [Go module versioning](https://go.dev/doc/modules/version-numbers#v0-number) for more details). It can be used in production but makes no stability or backward compatibility guarantees. We do not provide backward bug fixes and, therefore, always suggest using the newest version. We are providing only limited support for the provider; priorities will be assigned on a case-by-case basis. Our main current goals are stabilization, addressing existing issues, and providing the missing features (prioritizing the GA features; supporting PrPr and PuPr features are not high priorities now). With all that in mind, we aim to reach V1 with a stable, reliable, and functional provider. V1 will be free of all the above limitations.

~> **Note** Please check the [migration guide](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md) when changing the version of the provider.

-> **Note** The current roadmap is available in our GitHub repository: [ROADMAP.md](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/ROADMAP.md).

This is a terraform provider plugin for managing [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/) accounts.
Coverage is focused on part of Snowflake related to access control.


## Example Provider Configuration

This is an example configuration of the provider in `main.tf` in a configuration directory. More examples are provided [below](#order-precedence).

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    snowflake = {
      source = "Snowflake-Labs/snowflake"
    }
  }
}

# A simple configuration of the provider with a default authentication.
# A default value for `authenticator` is `snowflake`, enabling authentication with `user` and `password`.
provider "snowflake" {
  organization_name = "..." # required if not using profile. Can also be set via SNOWFLAKE_ORGANIZATION_NAME env var
  account_name      = "..." # required if not using profile. Can also be set via SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT_NAME env var
  user              = "..." # required if not using profile or token. Can also be set via SNOWFLAKE_USER env var
  password          = "..."

  // optional
  role      = "..."
  host      = "..."
  warehouse = "..."
  params = {
    query_tag = "..."
  }
}

# A simple configuration of the provider with private key authentication.
provider "snowflake" {
  organization_name      = "..." # required if not using profile. Can also be set via SNOWFLAKE_ORGANIZATION_NAME env var
  account_name           = "..." # required if not using profile. Can also be set via SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT_NAME env var
  user                   = "..." # required if not using profile or token. Can also be set via SNOWFLAKE_USER env var
  authenticator          = "SNOWFLAKE_JWT"
  private_key            = "-----BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----..."
  private_key_passphrase = "passphrase"
}

# By using the `profile` field, missing fields will be populated from ~/.snowflake/config TOML file
provider "snowflake" {
  profile = "securityadmin"
}
```

## Authentication

The Snowflake provider support multiple ways to authenticate:

* Password
* OAuth Access Token
* OAuth Refresh Token
* Browser Auth
* Private Key
* Config File

In all cases `organization_name`, `account_name` and `user` are required.

### Keypair Authentication Environment Variables

You should generate the public and private keys and set up environment variables.

```shell

cd ~/.ssh
openssl genrsa -out snowflake_key 4096
openssl rsa -in snowflake_key -pubout -out snowflake_key.pub
```

To export the variables into your provider:

```shell
export SNOWFLAKE_USER="..."
export SNOWFLAKE_PRIVATE_KEY="~/.ssh/snowflake_key"
```

### Keypair Authentication Passphrase

If your private key requires a passphrase, then this can be supplied via the
environment variable `SNOWFLAKE_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSPHRASE`.

Only the ciphers aes-128-cbc, aes-128-gcm, aes-192-cbc, aes-192-gcm,
aes-256-cbc, aes-256-gcm, and des-ede3-cbc are supported on the private key

```shell
cd ~/.ssh
openssl genrsa -out snowflake_key 4096
openssl rsa -in snowflake_key -pubout -out snowflake_key.pub
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform pem -in snowflake_key -outform PEM -v2 aes-256-cbc -out snowflake_key.p8
```

To export the variables into your provider:

```shell
export SNOWFLAKE_USER="..."
export SNOWFLAKE_PRIVATE_KEY="~/.ssh/snowflake_key.p8"
export SNOWFLAKE_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSPHRASE="..."
```

### OAuth Access Token

If you have an OAuth access token, export these credentials as environment variables:

```shell
export SNOWFLAKE_USER='...'
export SNOWFLAKE_TOKEN='...'
```

Note that once this access token expires, you'll need to request a new one through an external application.

### OAuth Refresh Token

If you have an OAuth Refresh token, export these credentials as environment variables:

```shell
export SNOWFLAKE_TOKEN_ACCESSOR_REFRESH_TOKEN='...'
export SNOWFLAKE_TOKEN_ACCESSOR_CLIENT_ID='...'
export SNOWFLAKE_TOKEN_ACCESSOR_CLIENT_SECRET='...'
export SNOWFLAKE_TOKEN_ACCESSOR_TOKEN_ENDPOINT='...'
export SNOWFLAKE_TOKEN_ACCESSOR_REDIRECT_URI='https://localhost.com'
```

Note because access token have a short life; typically 10 minutes, by passing refresh token new access token will be generated.

### Username and Password Environment Variables

If you choose to use Username and Password Authentication, export these credentials:

```shell
export SNOWFLAKE_USER='...'
export SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD='...'
```

## Order Precedence

Currently, the provider can be configured in three ways:
1. In a Terraform file located in the Terraform module with other resources.

Example content of the Terraform file configuration:

```terraform
provider "snowflake" {
    organization_name = "..."
    account_name = "..."
    username = "..."
    password = "..."
}
```

2. In environmental variables (envs). This is mainly used to provide sensitive values.


```bash
export SNOWFLAKE_USER="..."
export SNOWFLAKE_PRIVATE_KEY="~/.ssh/snowflake_key"
```

3. In a TOML file (default in ~/.snowflake/config). Notice the use of different profiles. The profile name needs to be specified in the Terraform configuration file in `profile` field. When this is not specified, `default` profile is loaded.
When a `default` profile is not present in the TOML file, it is treated as "empty", without failing.

Example content of the Terraform file configuration:

```terraform
provider "snowflake" {
    profile = "default"
}
```

Example content of the TOML file configuration:

```toml
[default]
organizationname='organization_name'
accountname='account_name'
user='user'
password='password'
role='ACCOUNTADMIN'

[secondary_test_account]
organizationname='organization_name'
accountname='account2_name'
user='user'
password='password'
role='ACCOUNTADMIN'
```

Not all fields must be configured in one source; users can choose which fields are configured in which source.
Provider uses an established hierarchy of sources. The current behavior is that for each field:
1. Check if it is present in the provider configuration. If yes, use this value. If not, go to step 2.
1. Check if it is present in the environment variables. If yes, use this value. If not, go to step 3.
1. Check if it is present in the TOML config file (specifically, use the profile name configured in one of the steps above). If yes, use this value. If not, the value is considered empty.

An example TOML file contents:

```toml
[example]
accountname = 'account_name'
organizationname = 'organization_name'
user = 'user'
password = 'password'
warehouse = 'SNOWFLAKE'
role = 'ACCOUNTADMIN'
clientip = '1.2.3.4'
protocol = 'https'
port = 443
oktaurl = 'https://example.com'
clienttimeout = 10
jwtclienttimeout = 20
logintimeout = 30
requesttimeout = 40
jwtexpiretimeout = 50
externalbrowsertimeout = 60
maxretrycount = 1
authenticator = 'snowflake'
insecuremode = true
ocspfailopen = true
keepsessionalive = true
disabletelemetry = true
validatedefaultparameters = true
clientrequestmfatoken = true
clientstoretemporarycredential = true
tracing = 'info'
tmpdirpath = '/tmp/terraform-provider/'
disablequerycontextcache = true
includeretryreason = true
disableconsolelogin = true

[example.params]
param_key = 'param_value'
```

An example terraform configuration file equivalent:

```terraform
provider "snowflake" {
	organization_name = "organization_name"
	account_name = "account_name"
	user = "user"
	password = "password"
	warehouse = "SNOWFLAKE"
	protocol = "https"
	port = "443"
	role = "ACCOUNTADMIN"
	validate_default_parameters = true
	client_ip = "1.2.3.4"
	authenticator = "snowflake"
	okta_url = "https://example.com"
	login_timeout = 10
	request_timeout = 20
	jwt_expire_timeout = 30
	client_timeout = 40
	jwt_client_timeout = 50
	external_browser_timeout = 60
	insecure_mode = true
	ocsp_fail_open = true
	keep_session_alive = true
	disable_telemetry = true
	client_request_mfa_token = true
	client_store_temporary_credential = true
	disable_query_context_cache = true
	include_retry_reason = true
	max_retry_count = 3
	driver_tracing = "info"
	tmp_directory_path = "/tmp/terraform-provider/"
	disable_console_login = true
	params = {
		param_key = "param_value"
	}
}
```
