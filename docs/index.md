## Support

For official support and urgent, production-impacting issues, please [contact Snowflake Support](https://community.snowflake.com/s/article/How-To-Submit-a-Support-Case-in-Snowflake-Lodge).
This support channel is limited to issues directly related to the provider. For third-party solutions using this provider, please reach out to the associated third-party support team.

~> **Keep in mind** that the official support starts with the [v2.0.0](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/2.0.0) version for stable resources only. All previous versions and preview resources are not officially supported. Also, consult [supported architectures](#supported-architectures).

Please follow [creating issues guidelines](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/CREATING_ISSUES.md), [FAQ](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/FAQ.md), and [known issues](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/KNOWN_ISSUES.md) before submitting an issue on GitHub or directly to Snowflake Support.

# Snowflake Provider

~> **Disclaimer** The project is in GA version, but some features are in preview. Such resources and data sources are considered preview features in the provider, regardless of their state in Snowflake. We do not guarantee their stability. They will be reworked and marked as a stable feature in future releases. Breaking changes in these features are expected, even without bumping the major version. They are disabled by default. To use them, add the relevant feature name to `preview_features_enabled` field in the [provider configuration](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs#schema). The list of preview features is available below. Please always refer to the [Getting Help](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-help) section in our Github repo to best determine how to get help for your questions. You can also use [`experimental_features_enabled`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs#experimental_features_enabled-1) to alter the provider's behavior. **It's still considered a preview feature, even when applied to the stable resources.**

~> **Note** Please check the [migration guide](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md) when changing the version of the provider.

!> **Sensitive values** Important: Do not include credentials, personal identifiers, or other regulated or sensitive information (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS data) in non-sensitive fields. Snowflake marks specific fields as sensitive—such as passwords, private keys, and tokens, meaning these fields will not appear in logs. Each sensitive field is properly marked in the documentation. All other fields are treated as non-sensitive by default. Some of them, like [task's](./resources/task) configuration, may contain sensitive information but are not marked as sensitive - you are responsible for safeguarding these fields according to your organization's security standards and regulatory requirements. Snowflake will not be liable for any exposure of data placed in non-sensitive fields. Read more in the [Sensitive values limitations](#sensitive-values-limitations) section.

-> **Note** The current roadmap is available in our GitHub repository: [ROADMAP.md](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/ROADMAP.md).

This is a terraform provider plugin for managing [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/) accounts.
Coverage is focused on part of Snowflake related to access control.

## Supported architectures

We have compiled a list to clarify which binaries are officially supported and which are provided additionally but not officially supported.
The lists are based on what the underlying [gosnowflake driver](https://github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake) supports and what [HashiCorp recommends for Terraform providers](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/registry/providers/os-arch).

The provider officially supports the binaries built for the following OSes and architectures:
- Windows: amd64
- Linux: amd64 and arm64
- Darwin: amd64 and arm64

Currently, we also provide the binaries for the following OSes and architectures, but they are not officially supported, and we do not prioritize fixes for them:
- Windows: arm64 and 386
- Linux: 386
- Darwin: 386
- Freebsd: any architecture

## Example Provider Configuration

This is an example configuration of the provider in `main.tf` in a configuration directory. More examples are provided [below](#order-precedence).

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    snowflake = {
      source = "snowflakedb/snowflake"
    }
  }
}

# A simple configuration of the provider with a default authentication.
# A default value for `authenticator` is `snowflake`, enabling authentication with `user` and `password`.
provider "snowflake" {
  organization_name = "..." # required if not using profile. Can also be set via SNOWFLAKE_ORGANIZATION_NAME env var
  account_name      = "..." # required if not using profile. Can also be set via SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT_NAME env var
  user              = "..." # required if not using profile or token. Can also be set via SNOWFLAKE_USER env var
  password          = "..."

  // optional
  role      = "..."
  host      = "..."
  warehouse = "..."
  params = {
    query_tag = "..."
  }
}

# A simple configuration of the provider with private key authentication.
provider "snowflake" {
  organization_name      = "..." # required if not using profile. Can also be set via SNOWFLAKE_ORGANIZATION_NAME env var
  account_name           = "..." # required if not using profile. Can also be set via SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT_NAME env var
  user                   = "..." # required if not using profile or token. Can also be set via SNOWFLAKE_USER env var
  authenticator          = "SNOWFLAKE_JWT"
  private_key            = file("~/.ssh/snowflake_key.p8")
  private_key_passphrase = var.private_key_passphrase
}

# Remember to provide the passphrase securely.
variable "private_key_passphrase" {
  type      = string
  sensitive = true
}

# By using the `profile` field, missing fields will be populated from ~/.snowflake/config TOML file
provider "snowflake" {
  profile = "securityadmin"
}
```

## Configuration Schema

**Warning: these values are passed directly to the gosnowflake library, which may not work exactly the way you expect. See the [gosnowflake docs](https://godoc.org/github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake#hdr-Connection_Parameters) for more.**

-> **Note**: In Go Snowflake driver 1.12.1 ([release notes](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/clients-drivers/golang-2024#version-1-12-1-december-05-2024)), configuration field `InsecureMode` has been deprecated in favor of `DisableOCSPChecks`. This field is not available in the provider yet. Please use `InsecureMode` instead, which has the same behavior. We are planning to support this new field and deprecate the old one.

-> **Note** If a field has a default value, it is shown next to the type in the schema. Most of the values in provider schema can be sourced from environment value (check field descriptions), but If a specified environment variable is not found, then the driver's default value is used instead.

Can also be sourced from the `SNOWFLAKE_TFC_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_TOKEN_TAG` environment variable.
- `tmp_directory_path` (String) Sets temporary directory used by the driver for operations like encrypting, compressing etc. Can also be sourced from the `SNOWFLAKE_TMP_DIRECTORY_PATH` environment variable.
- `token` (String, Sensitive) Token to use for OAuth and other forms of token based auth. When this field is set here, or in the TOML file, the provider sets the `authenticator` to `OAUTH`. Optionally, set the `authenticator` field to the authenticator you want to use. Can also be sourced from the `SNOWFLAKE_TOKEN` environment variable.
- `token_accessor` (Block List, Max: 1) If you are using the OAuth authentication flows, use the dedicated `authenticator` and `oauth...` fields instead. See our [authentication methods guide](./guides/authentication_methods) for more information. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--token_accessor))
- `use_legacy_toml_file` (Boolean) False by default. When this is set to true, the provider expects the legacy TOML format. Otherwise, it expects the new format. See more in [the section below](#examples) Can also be sourced from the `SNOWFLAKE_USE_LEGACY_TOML_FILE` environment variable.
- `user` (String) Username. Required unless using `profile`. Can also be sourced from the `SNOWFLAKE_USER` environment variable.
- `validate_default_parameters` (String) True by default. If false, disables the validation checks for Database, Schema, Warehouse and Role at the time a connection is established. Can also be sourced from the `SNOWFLAKE_VALIDATE_DEFAULT_PARAMETERS` environment variable.
- `warehouse` (String) Specifies the virtual warehouse to use by default for queries, loading, etc. in the client session. Can also be sourced from the `SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE` environment variable.
- `workload_identity_entra_resource` (String) The resource to use for WIF authentication on Azure environment. Can also be sourced from the `SNOWFLAKE_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_ENTRA_RESOURCE` environment variable.
- `workload_identity_provider` (String) The workload identity provider to use for WIF authentication. Can also be sourced from the `SNOWFLAKE_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER` environment variable.

<a id="nestedblock--token_accessor"></a>
### Nested Schema for `token_accessor`

Required:

- `client_id` (String, Sensitive) The client ID for the OAuth provider when using a refresh token to renew access token. Can also be sourced from the `SNOWFLAKE_TOKEN_ACCESSOR_CLIENT_ID` environment variable.
- `client_secret` (String, Sensitive) The client secret for the OAuth provider when using a refresh token to renew access token. Can also be sourced from the `SNOWFLAKE_TOKEN_ACCESSOR_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variable.
- `redirect_uri` (String, Sensitive) The redirect URI for the OAuth provider when using a refresh token to renew access token. Can also be sourced from the `SNOWFLAKE_TOKEN_ACCESSOR_REDIRECT_URI` environment variable.
- `refresh_token` (String, Sensitive) The refresh token for the OAuth provider when using a refresh token to renew access token. Can also be sourced from the `SNOWFLAKE_TOKEN_ACCESSOR_REFRESH_TOKEN` environment variable.
- `token_endpoint` (String, Sensitive) The token endpoint for the OAuth provider e.g. https://{yourDomain}/oauth/token when using a refresh token to renew access token. Can also be sourced from the `SNOWFLAKE_TOKEN_ACCESSOR_TOKEN_ENDPOINT` environment variable.

## Authentication

The Snowflake provider supports multiple ways to authenticate:

* Password
* PAT (Personal Access Token)
* OAuth Access Token
* OAuth Refresh Token
* Browser Auth
* Private Key
* Config File
* Oauth with Client Credentials
* Oauth with Authorization Code
* Workload Identity Federation (WIF)

In all cases `organization_name`, and `account_name` are required. In all cases except for Oauth with Client Credentials, `user` is required.

-> **Note** Storing the credentials and other secret values safely is on the users' side. Read more in [Authentication Methods guide](./guides/authentication_methods).

### Keypair Authentication Environment Variables

You should generate the public and private keys and set up environment variables.

```shell

cd ~/.ssh
openssl genrsa -out snowflake_key 4096
openssl rsa -in snowflake_key -pubout -out snowflake_key.pub
```

To export the variables into your provider:

```shell
export SNOWFLAKE_USER="..."
export SNOWFLAKE_PRIVATE_KEY=$(cat ~/.ssh/snowflake_key.p8)
```

-> **Note** See the [authentication methods guide](./guides/authentication_methods#private-key-format) for more details about the private key format.

### Keypair Authentication Passphrase

If your private key requires a passphrase, then this can be supplied via the
environment variable `SNOWFLAKE_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSPHRASE`.

Only the ciphers aes-128-cbc, aes-128-gcm, aes-192-cbc, aes-192-gcm,
aes-256-cbc, aes-256-gcm, and des-ede3-cbc are supported on the private key

```shell
cd ~/.ssh
openssl genrsa -out snowflake_key 4096
openssl rsa -in snowflake_key -pubout -out snowflake_key.pub
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform pem -in snowflake_key -outform PEM -v2 aes-256-cbc -out snowflake_key.p8
```

To export the variables into your provider:

```shell
export SNOWFLAKE_USER="..."
export SNOWFLAKE_PRIVATE_KEY=$(cat ~/.ssh/snowflake_key.p8)
export SNOWFLAKE_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSPHRASE="..."
```

### OAuth Access Token

If you have an OAuth access token, export these credentials as environment variables:

```shell
export SNOWFLAKE_USER='...'
export SNOWFLAKE_TOKEN='...'
```

Note that once this access token expires, you'll need to request a new one through an external application.

### OAuth Refresh Token

If you have an OAuth Refresh token, export these credentials as environment variables:

```shell
export SNOWFLAKE_TOKEN_ACCESSOR_REFRESH_TOKEN='...'
export SNOWFLAKE_TOKEN_ACCESSOR_CLIENT_ID='...'
export SNOWFLAKE_TOKEN_ACCESSOR_CLIENT_SECRET='...'
export SNOWFLAKE_TOKEN_ACCESSOR_TOKEN_ENDPOINT='...'
export SNOWFLAKE_TOKEN_ACCESSOR_REDIRECT_URI='https://localhost.com'
```

Note because access token have a short life; typically 10 minutes, by passing refresh token new access token will be generated.

### Username and Password Environment Variables

If you choose to use Username and Password Authentication, export these credentials:

```shell
export SNOWFLAKE_USER='...'
export SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD='...'
```

### Oauth with Client Credentials Environment Variables

If you choose to use Oauth with Client Credentials Authentication, export these credentials:

```shell
export SNOWFLAKE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID='...'
export SNOWFLAKE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET='...'
export SNOWFLAKE_OAUTH_TOKEN_REQUEST_URL='...'
```

### Oauth with Authorization Code Environment Variables

If you choose to use Oauth with Authorization Code Authentication, export these credentials:

```shell
export SNOWFLAKE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID='...'
export SNOWFLAKE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET='...'
export SNOWFLAKE_OAUTH_AUTHORIZATION_URL='...'
export SNOWFLAKE_OAUTH_TOKEN_REQUEST_URL='...'
export SNOWFLAKE_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI='...'
export SNOWFLAKE_OAUTH_SCOPE='...'
```

### Workload Identity Federation (WIF) Authentication

If you choose to use Workload Identity Federation (WIF) Authentication, export these credentials:

```shell
export SNOWFLAKE_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER='...'
export SNOWFLAKE_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_ENTRA_RESOURCE='...'
```

## Order Precedence

Currently, the provider can be configured in three ways:
1. In a Terraform file located in the Terraform module with other resources.
2. In environmental variables (envs). This is mainly used to provide sensitive values.
3. In a TOML file (default in `~/.snowflake/config`).

### Terraform file located in the Terraform module with other resources
One of the methods of configuring the provider is in the Terraform module. Read more in the [Terraform docs](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/providers/configuration).

Example content of the Terraform file configuration:

```terraform
provider "snowflake" {
    organization_name = "..."
    account_name = "..."
    username = "..."
    password = "..."
}
```

### Environmental variables
The second method is to use environmental variables. This is mainly used to provide sensitive values.

```bash
export SNOWFLAKE_USER="..."
export SNOWFLAKE_PRIVATE_KEY=$(cat ~/.ssh/snowflake_key.p8)
```

### TOML file
The third method is to use a TOML configuration file (default location in ~/.snowflake/config). Notice the use of different profiles. The profile name needs to be specified in the Terraform configuration file in `profile` field. When this is not specified, `default` profile is loaded.
When a `default` profile is not present in the TOML file, it is treated as "empty", without failing.

Read [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) specification for more details on the syntax.

-> **Note** This configuration file is distinct from the ones used to configure [Snowflake CLI](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowflake-cli/connecting/configure-cli) or [SnowSQL](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowsql-config).

Example content of the Terraform file configuration:

```terraform
provider "snowflake" {
    profile = "default"
}
```

Example content of the TOML file configuration is listed below. Note that this example follows a new TOML format, for the legacy format see [examples](#examples) section.

```toml
[default]
organization_name='organization_name'
account_name='account_name'
user='user'
password='password'
role='ACCOUNTADMIN'

[secondary_test_account]
organization_name='organization_name'
account_name='account2_name'
user='user'
password='password'
role='ACCOUNTADMIN'
```

#### TOML file limitations
To ensure a better security of the provider, the following limitations are introduced:

-> **Note** TOML file size is limited to 10MB.

-> **Note** Only TOML file with restricted privileges can be read. Any privileges for group or others cannot be set (the maximum valid privilege is `700`). You can set the expected privileges like `chmod 0600 ~/.snowflake/config`. This is checked only on non-Windows platforms. If you are using the provider on Windows, please make sure that your configuration file has not too permissive privileges.

### Source Hierarchy
Not all fields must be configured in one source; users can choose which fields are configured in which source.
Provider uses an established hierarchy of sources. The current behavior is that for each field:
1. Check if it is present in the provider configuration. If yes, use this value. If not, go to step 2.
1. Check if it is present in the environment variables. If yes, use this value. If not, go to step 3.
1. Check if it is present in the TOML config file (specifically, use the profile name configured in one of the steps above). If yes, use this value. If not, the value is considered empty.

-> **Note** Currently `private_key` and `private_key_passphrase` are coupled and must be set in one source (both on Terraform side or both in TOML config, see https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/3332). This will be fixed in the future.

-> **Note** Currently both legacy and new formats are supported. The new format can be enabled with setting `use_legacy_toml_file = false` in the provider configuration. We encourage using the new format for now, as it will be a default one in v2 version of the provider. The differences between these formats are:
- The keys in the provider contain an underscore (`_`) as a separator, but the TOML schema has fields without any separator.
- The field `driver_tracing` in the provider is related to `tracing` in the TOML schema.

## Proxy

Terraform is plugin-based. It means that every plugin (provider) is responsible for making its own network requests.
Not all providers follow the same standardized ways, so familiarize yourself with proxy setting for each of the providers used within your module.

A few important pointers for setting the proxy connection:
- As far as we are aware, there are no official Terraform docs regarding proxy, but there are some discussions on the official HashiCorp discussion forum (e.g. [this one](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/t/use-terraform-in-an-internal-network/59464)).
- Terraform relies on Go default proxy setting (so it supports `HTTPS_PROXY`, `HTTP_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY`).
- The official Go driver for Snowflake, which is used in this provider, also supports the default Go environment variables (`HTTPS_PROXY`, `HTTP_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY`). Documented [here](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake#hdr-Proxy).
- The provider offers a separate config (through the provider block, dedicated environment variables, and the TOML file).
- The order of precedence is as follows:
  1. Provider configuration (following its own [precedence](#order-precedence)).
  2. Standard environment variables (`HTTPS_PROXY`, `HTTP_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY`).

References:
- [Hashicorp discussion group example](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/t/use-terraform-in-an-internal-network/59464)
- [Go driver documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake#hdr-Proxy)
- [Go documentation](https://go.dev/src/vendor/golang.org/x/net/http/httpproxy/proxy.go)

## Sensitive values limitations

The provider marks fields containing access credentials and other such information as sensitive. This means that the values of these fields will not be logged.

There are some limitations to this mechanism:
- Sensitive values are stored as plaintext in the state file. This is a limitation of Terraform itself ([reference](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/configuration-language/sensitive-variables#sensitive-values-in-state)). You should take care to secure access to the state file.
- In [Plugin SDK](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2) there is no possibility to mark sensitive values conditionally ([reference](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/issues/736)). This means it is not possible to mark sensitive values based on other fields, like marking `body` based on the value of `secure` field in views, functions, and procedures. As a result, this field is not marked as sensitive. For such cases, we add disclaimers in the resource documentation.
- In Plugin SDK, there is no possibility to mark sensitive values in nested fields ([reference](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/issues/201)). This means the nested fields, like these in `show_output` and `describe_output` cannot be sensitive.
As a result, such nested fields are not marked as sensitive. For such cases, we add disclaimers in the resource documentation. Additionally, some fields are missing from `show_output` and `describe_output`. However, these fields are present in the resource's root, so they can still be referenced.
The alternative solution we considered was setting the whole `show_output` and `describe_output` as sensitive. However, this solution could reduce the provider functionality and would require changes in user's configurations.
- Sensitive values cannot be used as `for_each` keys ([reference](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/2668#issuecomment-2071025202)). This means that if a resource attribute is marked as sensitive (e.g. `name` in `snowflake_user`), it cannot be used directly in a `for_each` expression. For example, iterating over a set of user names to create role grants will fail with `Sensitive values, or values derived from sensitive values, cannot be used as for_each arguments`. The workaround is to wrap the sensitive value with the [`nonsensitive`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/functions/nonsensitive) function when you are certain the value is not actually sensitive in your context (e.g. a username that is not a secret):
  ```terraform
  resource "snowflake_user" "example" {
    name = "my_user"
  }

  resource "snowflake_role" "example" {
    name = "my_role"
  }

  resource "snowflake_grant_account_role" "example" {
    for_each  = toset([for u in [snowflake_user.example.name] : nonsensitive(u)])
    role_name = snowflake_role.example.name
    user_name = each.value
  }
  ```
  Note: use `nonsensitive` only when you are confident the value does not need to be protected. Misuse can inadvertently expose secrets in logs or plan output.

As a general rule, please ensure that no personal data, sensitive data, export-controlled data, or other regulated data is entered as metadata when using the provider. If you use one of these fields, they may be present in logs, so ensure that the provider logs are properly restricted. For more information, see [Sensitive values limitations](../#sensitive-values-limitations) and [Metadata fields in Snowflake](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/metadata).

Read more about sensitive values in the [Terraform documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/configuration-language/sensitive-variables).

We are planning to research migration to Plugin Framework and we will investigate if the limitations coming from Plugin SDK can be addressed.

## Features

### Operation Timeouts
By default, Terraform sets resource operation timeouts to 20 minutes ([reference](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/retries-and-customizable-timeouts#default-timeouts-and-deadline-exceeded-errors)). Now, the provider enables configuration of these values by users in `timeouts` block in each resource.
The default timeouts are in general aligned with the Terraform defaults. If a resource has different timeouts, it is specified in the resource documentation.

Data sources will be supported in the future.
Read more in following [official documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts)).

You can specify the timeouts like the following:
```terraform

resource "snowflake_execute" "test" {
  execute = "CREATE DATABASE ABC"
  revert  = "DROP DATABASE ABC"
  query   = "SHOW DATABASES LIKE '%ABC%'"

  timeouts {
    create = "10m"
    read   = "10m"
    update = "10m"
    delete = "10m"
  }
}
```

-> Note: Timeouts can be also set at driver's level (see [driver documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake)). These timeouts are independent. We recommend tweaking the timeouts on Terraform level first.

## General provider rules

> Note: This section is in a `work in progress` state and will be updated over time.

In this section, we describe general rules that apply to multiple resources and data sources in the provider.
This may help you understand the provider behavior when you are getting started with it.

However, getting familiar with existing guides (`Guides` section on the left),
resource-specific documentation, and Snowflake-specific documentation for a given object is still recommended.

Here's a list of general rules:
- All fields representing object identifiers (e.g., [allowed_network_rule_list](./resources/network_policy#allowed_network_rule_list-1) in `snowflake_network_policy`) or parts of them (e.g., `database`, `schema`, and `name` in the [snowflake_network_rule](./resources/network_rule#required) resource) are case-sensitive. This is true for all stable resources (there may be some exceptions in the preview ones; especially older ones). However, you can make all identifiers case-insensitive by enabling [QUOTED_IDENTIFIERS_IGNORE_CASE](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/parameters#quoted-identifiers-ignore-case), but be aware with the [issues you may have when using it](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/KNOWN_ISSUES.md#using-quoted_identifiers_ignore_case-with-the-provider).

## A list of preview and stable resources and data sources

The provider supports a number of Snowflake features. Within the provider, some features are stable, while others are in preview
(stability of the feature in the provider is not connected to the stability of the feature in Snowflake).

Preview features are **experimental** and may introduce **breaking changes**, even between non-major versions of the provider.
Eventually, every preview resource will be promoted to stable, but the timeline for each feature is not defined (you can find more details on the current/future plans in [our roadmap](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/ROADMAP.md)).
New resources will be introduced as preview ones and promoted over time to stable as we gain more confidence in their stability.

Preview features are disabled by default and should be used with caution.
To use them, add the relevant feature name to the `preview_features_enabled` field in the [provider configuration](#preview_features_enabled-1).

## Experimental features

Experiments alter the provider behavior.
Similarly to preview features, they are not yet stable features of the provider.
Enabling the given experiment is still considered a preview feature, even when applied to the stable resource.
If the given experiment is successful, it can be considered an addition in the future provider versions.

### Active experiments

The following experiments are currently active. Depending on the feedback, we may decide to include them as default behavior/stable feature of the provider in the future.

To share feedback please reach out to us through your Snowflake account manager.

#### WAREHOUSE_SHOW_IMPROVED_PERFORMANCE
It's meant to improve the performance for accounts with many warehouses.

When enabled, it uses a slightly different SHOW query to read warehouse details (`SHOW WAREHOUSES LIKE '<identifier>' STARTS WITH '<identifier>' LIMIT 1`).

This feature is enabled by default on the Snowflake side.

#### GRANTS_STRICT_PRIVILEGE_MANAGEMENT
The new `strict_privilege_management` flag was added to the `snowflake_grant_privileges_to_account_role` resource.

It has similar behavior to the `enable_multiple_grants` flag present in the old grant resources, and it makes the resource able to detect external changes for privileges other than those present in the configuration which can make the `snowflake_grant_privileges_to_account_role` resource a central point of knowledge privilege management for a given object and role.

Read more in our [strict privilege management](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/guides/strict_privilege_management) guide.

This feature works independently of the `GRANTS_IMPORT_VALIDATION` flag.

#### PARAMETERS_IGNORE_VALUE_CHANGES_IF_NOT_ON_OBJECT_LEVEL
Currently, not setting the parameter value on the object level can unnecessarily react to external changes to this parameter's value on the higher levels (e.g. not setting `data_retention_time_in_days` on `snowflake_schema` can result in non-empty plan when the parameter value changes on the database/account level).

When enabled, the provider ignores changes to the parameter value happening on the higher hierarchy levels.

#### PARAMETERS_REDUCED_OUTPUT
Currently, the `parameters` field in various resources contains a verbatim output for the `SHOW PARAMETERS IN <object>` command. One of the fields contained in the output is the `description`. It does not change and is repeated for all objects containing the given parameter. It leads to an excessive output (check e.g., [#3118](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/3118)).

To mitigate the problem, we are adding this option to reduce the output to only `value` and `level` fields, which should significantly reduce the state size. **Note**: it's also affecting the `parameters` output for data sources.

We considered the option to remove the `parameters` output completely, however, we plan to change the external change logic detection to use it (to make it consistent with other attributes using `show_output` and because we won't be able to implement the current logic when switching to the Terraform Plugin Framework) and it still allows referencing the parameter value/level from other parts of the configuration.

#### USER_ENABLE_DEFAULT_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY
The new `default_workload_identity_federation` field was added to the `snowflake_legacy_service_user` and `snowflake_service_user` resources. This field allows for managing WIFs. Due to feature complexity, it requires enabling this experiment.

Read more in our [migration guide](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/dev/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md#new-feature-workload-identity-federation-support-for-service-users).

#### GRANTS_IMPORT_VALIDATION
Enables import validation for the `snowflake_grant_privileges_to_account_role` resource.

When enabled, importing a grant resource with a fixed set of privileges (`privileges` field) will validate that the specified privileges actually exist in Snowflake with the correct `with_grant_option` setting, and error immediately if they don't match.

This feature works independently of the `GRANTS_STRICT_PRIVILEGE_MANAGEMENT` flag.

#### TAGS_ALLOW_EMPTY_ALLOWED_VALUES
Enables behavior changes for the `allowed_values` field in the `snowflake_tag` resource.

When enabled, the three possible states in Snowflake for allowed values will be supported: `nil` (any value is allowed; whenever `allowed_values` are empty), `empty` (no value is allowed; handled by the `no_allowed_values` field), and `set` (all values defined in `allowed_values` are allowed).

Otherwise, the `no_allowed_values` field will be ignored (explicit changes will cause updates, but without any effect) and the `allowed_values` field will follow the old behavior: `nil` (any value is allowed; only available whenever tag resource is created without `allowed_values`), `empty` (no value is allowed; always set when updating from filled `allowed_values` set to empty one or completely removed from config), `set` (all values defined in `allowed_values` are allowed).

#### IMPORT_BOOLEAN_DEFAULT
Changes import behavior for boolean fields using the special `"default"` value.

When enabled, boolean fields using the special `"default"` value are set to `"default"` during import instead of the actual Snowflake value (e.g., `"false"`). This prevents unavoidable diffs on every plan after import.

Note: this is supported on all stage resources (`snowflake_stage_external_s3`, `snowflake_stage_external_azure`, `snowflake_stage_external_gcs`, `snowflake_stage_external_s3_compatible`, and `snowflake_stage_internal`) and stream resources (`snowflake_stream_on_table` and `snowflake_stream_on_view`).

#### GRANTS_SAFE_DESTROY
When enabled, grant destroy operations silently succeed when the underlying Snowflake object (or its dependencies) no longer exists.

Currently supported by: `snowflake_grant_privileges_to_account_role`, `snowflake_grant_privileges_to_database_role`, `snowflake_grant_privileges_to_share`, `snowflake_grant_account_role`, `snowflake_grant_database_role`, `snowflake_grant_application_role`, `snowflake_grant_ownership`.

This prevents errors when, for example, a warehouse or role is deleted externally and the corresponding grant resource is later removed from the Terraform configuration.

Without this experiment, destroying such resources fails with `does not exist or not authorized`.

#### TAG_ASSOCIATION_SAFE_DESTROY
When enabled, tag association destroy operations silently succeed when the tagged object (or its parent hierarchy) no longer exists.

Currently supported by: `snowflake_tag_association`.

This prevents errors when, for example, a table or schema is deleted externally and the corresponding tag association resource is later removed from the Terraform configuration.

Without this experiment, destroying such resources fails with `does not exist or not authorized`.

#### GRANT_ACCOUNT_ROLE_SHOW_CACHING
Enables per-plan in-memory caching of `SHOW GRANTS OF ROLE` results for the `snowflake_grant_account_role` resource.

Without caching, every resource instance issues an independent `SHOW GRANTS OF ROLE <name>` call during Read. In configurations with many grants sharing the same role, this results in N identical round-trips returning the same full result set — only 1 is needed.

When enabled, the first Read for a given role fetches and caches the result; subsequent Reads in the same plan reuse it. The cache is invalidated on Create and Delete so mutations within a single apply remain visible to subsequent Reads.

Additionally, the trailing Read at the end of Create is skipped (this resource has no computed or server-default fields to populate), removing a redundant `SHOW GRANTS OF ROLE` call per grant during apply.

Intended for large configurations (thousands of `snowflake_grant_account_role` resources) where plan and apply time is dominated by redundant `SHOW GRANTS OF ROLE` calls.

#### ACCOUNT_ROLE_SHOW_CACHING
When enabled, the result of looking up an account role by identifier (`SHOW ROLES LIKE '<name>'`, via the underlying `ShowByID`/`ShowByIDSafely` calls) is cached in memory for the duration of a single plan or apply cycle.

Currently supported by: `snowflake_account_role`, `snowflake_grant_application_role`, `snowflake_grant_privileges_to_account_role`.

Without caching, every lookup of a given role — whether it's the role's own `snowflake_account_role` Read, or an existence check performed by a grant resource before granting to/from it — issues an independent round trip, even when many resource instances reference the same role. When enabled, the first lookup for a given role fetches and caches the result; subsequent lookups in the same plan reuse it. The cache is invalidated on `snowflake_account_role` Update (rename or comment change) and Delete, since only that resource can change what a cached lookup would return.

This is a separate flag from `GRANT_ACCOUNT_ROLE_SHOW_CACHING`: enabling this does not enable caching for `snowflake_grant_account_role`'s `SHOW GRANTS OF ROLE` calls, and vice versa. Both can be enabled together.

Intended for large configurations (thousands of role or grant resources) where plan and apply time is dominated by redundant role lookups.

#### GRANTS_SHOW_CACHING
When enabled, `SHOW GRANTS` results are cached in memory for the duration of a single plan or apply cycle, so multiple resource instances resolving to the same underlying SHOW statement share one round-trip instead of each issuing their own.

Currently supported by: `snowflake_grant_privileges_to_account_role`, `snowflake_grant_ownership`.

Without caching, every resource instance issues an independent `SHOW GRANTS ON <object>` / `SHOW FUTURE GRANTS IN <container>` call during Read. In configurations with many grants resolving to the same underlying SHOW statement (e.g. many privilege grants on the same schema, or many future-grant roles on the same database), this results in N identical round-trips returning the same full result set — only 1 is needed.

The first Read for a given SHOW statement fetches and caches the result; subsequent Reads in the same plan reuse it. The cache is invalidated on Create, Update, and Delete of the resources listed above so mutations within a single apply remain visible to subsequent Reads.

This is a separate flag from `GRANT_ACCOUNT_ROLE_SHOW_CACHING`: enabling this does not enable caching for `snowflake_grant_account_role`, and vice versa. Both can be enabled together.

Intended for large configurations (thousands of grant resources) where plan and apply time is dominated by redundant `SHOW GRANTS` calls.

#### GRANT_ACCOUNT_ROLE_SAFE_PUBLIC_ROLE
When enabled, `snowflake_grant_account_role` treats granting the PUBLIC role as a silent no-op instead of producing an error.

Snowflake implicitly grants PUBLIC to every role and user (see [Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/security-access-control-overview#system-defined-roles)), so an explicit `GRANT ROLE PUBLIC` is always a no-op at the SQL level. However, the provider's Read function cannot find the explicit grant via `SHOW GRANTS` and clears the state, causing an inconsistent-result error.

With this experiment, Create, Read, and Delete all treat PUBLIC role grants as permanent fixtures that require no actual SQL.

#### HIERARCHY_RENAMES
When enabled, allows in-place handling of hierarchy renames and moves for supported resources.

Currently supported by: `snowflake_schema`, `snowflake_table`.

Without this experiment, changing the `database` field on `snowflake_schema` or the `database`/`schema` fields on `snowflake_table` forces resource recreation. With this experiment, the provider detects whether the parent was renamed or the object should be moved, and handles it without recreation.

#### INHERITED_GRANTS
Enables the `inherited` block in the `on_account_object`, `on_schema`, and `on_schema_object` blocks of the `snowflake_grant_privileges_to_account_role` resource, and in the `on_schema` and `on_schema_object` blocks of the `snowflake_grant_privileges_to_database_role` resource.

Without this experiment, using an `inherited` block results in an error.

#### OBJECT_PARAMETER_UNSET_ON_DELETE
Changes the delete behavior of the `snowflake_object_parameter` resource to use `ALTER <OBJECT_TYPE> <identifier> UNSET <PARAMETER>` instead of resetting the parameter to its default value.

Without this experiment, deleting the resource fetches the parameter's default value and explicitly sets it back, which is fragile and doesn't truly remove the object-level override.

When enabled, the parameter is properly unset, allowing the inherited value from the higher hierarchy level to take effect.

#### AUTHENTICATOR_EXPLICIT_ONLY
Removes implicit authenticator derivation from other provider configuration fields.

Without this experiment, the provider automatically sets the authenticator to `OAUTH` when the `token` or `token_accessor` field is configured, even if `authenticator` is not explicitly set. This implicit behavior can be confusing and will be removed in v3.

When enabled, the `authenticator` field must be set explicitly in the provider configuration or TOML profile. The `SNOWFLAKE` default (when no authenticator is configured anywhere) is preserved.

#### PROVIDER_CONFIGURATION_ACCOUNT_FALLBACK
Re-introduces the `account` field as a fallback for `organization_name` and `account_name` in both the provider configuration and TOML profiles.

When enabled, you can set `account` instead of setting `organization_name` and `account_name` separately. The field accepts both the `org-name` format (e.g. `"myorg-myaccount"`) and an account locator (e.g. `"xy12345"`). If both `organization_name` and `account_name` are set, they take precedence over `account`. The `SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT` environment variable is used as the `account` value only when this experiment is enabled.

Without this experiment, setting the `account` field in the provider configuration or in a TOML profile results in an error directing you to enable this experiment. A value coming from the `SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT` environment variable is ignored with a warning instead, because this experiment will be enabled by default in v3 and the variable will be taken into account from that version on.
