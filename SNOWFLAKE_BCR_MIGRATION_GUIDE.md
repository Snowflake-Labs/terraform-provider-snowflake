# Snowflake BCR migration guide

This document is meant to help you migrate your Terraform config and maintain compatibility after enabling given [Snowflake BCR Bundle](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/behavior-changes).
Some of the breaking changes on Snowflake side may be not compatible with the current version of the Terraform provider, so you may need to update your Terraform config to adapt to the new behavior.
As some changes may require work on the provider side, we advise you to always use the latest version of the provider ([new features and fixes policy](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/terraform#new-features-and-fixes)).
To avoid any issues and follow [migration guide](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md) when migrating to newer versions.
According to the [Bundle Lifecycle](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/intro-bcr-releases#bundle-lifecycle), changes are eventually enabled by default without the possibility to disable them, so it's important to know what is going to be introduced beforehand.
If you would like to test the new behavior before it is enabled by default, you can use the [SYSTEM\$ENABLE_BEHAVIOR_CHANGE_BUNDLE](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/system_enable_behavior_change_bundle)
command to enable the bundle manually, and then the [SYSTEM\$DISABLE_BEHAVIOR_CHANGE_BUNDLE](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/system_disable_behavior_change_bundle) command to disable it.

Remember that only changes that affect the provider are listed here, to get the full list of changes, please refer to the [Snowflake BCR Bundle documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/behavior-changes).
The `snowflake_execute` resource won't be listed here, as it is users' responsibility to check the SQL commands executed and adapt them to the new behavior.

## [Unbundled changes](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/bcr-bundles/un-bundled/unbundled-behavior-changes)

### Default package source changes for Snowpark Python break `snowflake_procedure_python` and `snowflake_function_python`

Starting **June 26, 2026**, when a Python procedure or function has no `ARTIFACT_REPOSITORY` (object level) or `DEFAULT_PYTHON_ARTIFACT_REPOSITORY` (schema/database/account level) configured, Snowflake implicitly resolves Snowpark and other packages from a built-in shared PyPI repository (`snowflake.snowpark.pypi_shared_repository`) instead of Anaconda. This applies to `runtime_version = "3.14"` and above in existing accounts, and to all Python runtime versions in newly created accounts.

Once an artifact repository is attached this way, `DESCRIBE PROCEDURE`/`DESCRIBE FUNCTION` moves the whole package list out of the `packages` property into a new `artifact_repository_packages` property. Neither [`snowflake_procedure_python`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/procedure_python) nor [`snowflake_function_python`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/function_python) parses that property, but the two resources fail differently:

- `snowflake_procedure_python` fails outright on any `terraform plan`/`apply` that reads the procedure back - including the `CREATE` step itself - with:

  ```
  Error: could not parse package from Snowflake, expected at least snowpark package, got []
  ```

- `snowflake_function_python` does not error. The apply succeeds, but `packages` silently comes back as an empty list in state, even though the function was created successfully and Snowflake resolved the packages correctly under the hood.

See [#5116](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/5116) (filed against `snowflake_procedure_python`; the same underlying gap affects `snowflake_function_python`, just without a loud error to surface it). Packages are resolved once, at `CREATE` time, so unsetting `DEFAULT_PYTHON_ARTIFACT_REPOSITORY` afterwards does not fix an already-created object - it has to be dropped and recreated. `snowflake_procedure_java`, `snowflake_procedure_scala`, `snowflake_function_java`, and `snowflake_function_scala` are not affected by this change; it only concerns the default resolution of Snowpark Python packages.

Until the provider adds support for artifact repositories, avoid this by:
- Not setting `ARTIFACT_REPOSITORY`/`DEFAULT_PYTHON_ARTIFACT_REPOSITORY` on schemas/databases/accounts that contain Terraform-managed `snowflake_procedure_python` or `snowflake_function_python` resources.
- If `DEFAULT_PYTHON_ARTIFACT_REPOSITORY` is already set at a higher level and cannot be unset, pinning it explicitly to `'snowflake.snowpark.anaconda_shared_repository'` for the object levels the procedures/functions live in, to keep the pre-BCR Anaconda resolution and `packages` shape.
- For existing accounts, staying on a `runtime_version` below `3.14` avoids the new default entirely.

### Argument output changes for SHOW FUNCTIONS and SHOW PROCEDURES commands

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This change has been rolled back from the BCR 2025_03.

Changed format in `Arguments` column from `SHOW FUNCTIONS/PROCEDURES` output is not compatible with the provider parsing function. It leads to:
- [`snowflake_functions`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/2.2.0/docs/data-sources/functions) and [`snowflake_procedures`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/2.2.0/docs/data-sources/procedures) being inoperable. Check: [#3822](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/3822).
- All function and all procedure resources failing to read their state from Snowflake, which leads to removing them from terraform state (if `terraform apply` or `terraform plan --refresh-only` is run). Check: [#3823](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/3823).

The parsing was improved and is available starting with the [2.3.0](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/2.3.0/docs/) version of the provider. This fix was also backported to the [1.2.3](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/releases/tag/v1.2.3) version.

To use the provider with the bundles containing this change:
1. Bump the provider to 2.3.0 version (or 1.2.3 version).
2. Affected data sources should work without any further actions after bumping.
3. If your function/procedure resources were removed from terraform state (you can check it by running `terraform state list`), you need to reimport them (follow our [resource migration guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/guides/resource_migration)).
4. If your function/procedure resources are still in the terraform state, they should work any further actions after bumping.

## [Bundle 2026_04](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/bcr-bundles/2026_04_bundle)

### CREATE FUNCTION and CREATE PROCEDURE: signature size limit reduced

When this bundle is enabled, the combined size of a function or procedure's name, parameter list, and return type is limited to **9,800 bytes** (previously 10,000 bytes).

This affects the following provider resources: [`snowflake_function_java`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/function_java), [`snowflake_function_javascript`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/function_javascript), [`snowflake_function_python`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/function_python), [`snowflake_function_scala`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/function_scala), [`snowflake_function_sql`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/function_sql), and their procedure equivalents. If a `CREATE` statement exceeds the new limit, Snowflake returns error `09024` and the provider propagates it through `terraform apply`.

In practice this only affects functions and procedures with unusually large signatures (e.g. hundreds of parameters combined with long names). If you hit error `09024`, shorten the function or procedure name, reduce the number of parameters, or shorten parameter names and types. The provider does not validate the signature size limit.

Reference: [BCR-2303](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/bcr-bundles/2026_04/bcr-2303)

## [Bundle 2026_03](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/bcr-bundles/2026_03_bundle)

### Standard warehouses: Gen2 is the default generation

When this bundle is enabled on your account, newly created standard warehouses default to `GENERATION = '2'` in regions where Gen2 is available (previously Gen1 in most regions).
No provider-side changes are required. Existing warehouses keep their current generation, and the [`snowflake_warehouse`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/warehouse) resource already suppresses drift on the `generation` attribute when it is not set in config.

If you want to pin a new or existing warehouse to Gen1, set `generation = "1"` explicitly. Otherwise, warehouses managed by Terraform without an explicit `generation` will come up as Gen2 after this bundle is active.

The provider issues `CREATE` and `ALTER` statements separately (not `CREATE OR ALTER`), so the BCR-2250 caveat about `CREATE OR ALTER` flipping an existing Gen1 warehouse to Gen2 does not apply to warehouses managed through this resource.

Reference: [BCR-2250](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/bcr-bundles/2026_03/bcr-2250)

### Warehouses: QAS enabled by default for newly created Gen2 and multi-cluster warehouses

When this bundle is enabled on your account, newly created Gen2 and multi-cluster warehouses have the Query Acceleration Service (QAS) enabled by default with `QUERY_ACCELERATION_MAX_SCALE_FACTOR = 2`. Gen1 single-cluster warehouses still default to QAS disabled with scale factor `8`.
No provider-side changes are required. Existing warehouses are not affected – altering a warehouse (including flipping it between Gen1/Gen2 or single/multi-cluster) does not toggle QAS, which matches how the [`snowflake_warehouse`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/warehouse) resource issues `ALTER` statements.

The resource already suppresses drift on `enable_query_acceleration` and `query_acceleration_max_scale_factor` when they are not set in config, so new warehouses picking up the new defaults will not cause plan churn. If you want to opt out, set the fields explicitly:

- `enable_query_acceleration = "false"` to keep QAS disabled on new Gen2/multi-cluster warehouses.
- `query_acceleration_max_scale_factor = <n>` to pick a specific scale factor.

Reference: [BCR-2269](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/bcr-bundles/2026_03/bcr-2269)

### 63-character limit for account identifiers

When this bundle is enabled on your account, Snowflake enforces on `CREATE ACCOUNT` and `ALTER ACCOUNT ... RENAME TO` that:

- The combined `<orgname>-<account_name>` identifier (Format 1) is at most 63 characters.
- The account name does not end with an underscore (`_`).

No provider-side changes are required; the restriction is enforced server-side and the provider propagates the resulting `ORG_ACCOUNT_NAME_EXCEEDS_DNS_LIMIT` / `ACCOUNT_NAME_INVALID_FOR_DNS` errors through `terraform apply`.

For accounts managed with the [`snowflake_account`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/account) resource, make sure that `length("<orgname>-<name>") <= 63` and that `name` does not end with `_` before applying. Otherwise the create or rename operation will fail with one of the errors above.

Existing accounts that do not comply with these limits continue to function, but Snowflake recommends renaming them to a compliant value. You can find non-compliant accounts with:

```sql
SHOW ACCOUNTS;

SELECT
  CURRENT_ORGANIZATION_NAME() || '-' || "account_name" AS identifier,
  LENGTH(identifier) AS len
FROM TABLE(RESULT_SCAN(LAST_QUERY_ID()))
WHERE len > 63 OR ENDSWITH("account_name", '_');
```

and analogously with `SHOW MANAGED ACCOUNTS`. Note that once you rename an account to a compliant name, you cannot rename it back to a non-compliant name – this is effectively a one-way migration.

## [Bundle 2026_02](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/bcr-bundles/2026_02_bundle)

### External OAuth security integrations: `EXTERNAL_OAUTH_JWS_KEYS_URL` requires HTTPS

The `EXTERNAL_OAUTH_JWS_KEYS_URL` parameter specifies the endpoint from which Snowflake retrieves public keys to validate OAuth access tokens. After this change, only HTTPS URLs are accepted; HTTP URLs are rejected.

If you manage External OAuth security integrations with the [`snowflake_external_oauth_integration`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/external_oauth_integration) resource, ensure `external_oauth_jws_keys_url` and `jws_keys_urls` use `https://` URLs before the bundle is active on your account.

Reference: [BCR-2218](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/bcr-bundles/2026_02/bcr-2218)

## [Bundle 2026_01](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/bcr-bundles/2026_01_bundle)

### CREATE INTEGRATION: `ENABLED` defaults to `TRUE`

When this bundle is enabled on your account, `CREATE ... INTEGRATION` statements that do not specify `ENABLED` default to `ENABLED = TRUE` (previously `FALSE`). This affects all integration types, including SAML2.

The [`snowflake_saml2_integration`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/saml2_integration) resource has been adjusted to align with this default. The UNSET operation for this integration is not supported in Snowflake, so when `enabled` is removed in config, the provider now sets this as `TRUE`. See the corresponding entry in the [migration guide](./MIGRATION_GUIDE.md#bug-fix-snowflake_saml2_integration-removing-enabled-from-config-now-restores-snowflakes-default-of-true) for details and recommended action.

If you want the integration to remain disabled, set `enabled = "false"` explicitly. Otherwise, no configuration changes are required.

## [Bundle 2025_07](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/bcr-bundles/2025_07_bundle)

### USAGE privilege on CATALOG INTEGRATION and EXTERNAL VOLUME required for database owner role for all operations

In certain scenarios, new privileges would be required to perform operations on catalog integrations and external volumes. You can manage these in Terraform with [grant_privileges_to_account_role](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/grant_privileges_to_account_role)
and [grant_privileges_to_database_role](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/grant_privileges_to_database_role).

Reference: [BCR-2114](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/bcr-bundles/2025_07/bcr-2114)

### New default column sizes for string and binary data types

Before this change, the default size was 16 MB for text and 8 MB for binary columns. With the new bundle, the defaults increase to 128 MB for text and 64 MB for binary columns.
For now, the provider will continue to use the old default size - 16 MB for text and 8 MB for binary. We are planning to adjust even more datatypes because of a new `DATA_TYPE_ALIAS` column in information schema - read [related BCR](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/bcr-bundles/2025_07/bcr-2061). We'll comeback to this in the future.

The datatype precision and scale can be specified for columns in the provider.

Reference: [BCR-2118](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/bcr-bundles/2025_07/bcr-2118)

### Disallow setting date and time output formats to AUTO

Snowflake now does not allow setting a number of time output parameters to `AUTO` - see the reference for the exact list. The provider does not validate such values in related resources. If you are using the `AUTO` value, adjust your configurations.

Reference: [BCR-2115](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/bcr-bundles/2025_07/bcr-2115)

### Python telemetry library automatically installed

Snowflake automatically installs the `snowflake-telemetry-python` package when a function or procedure with a Python handler is created. Read more about packages policy in [Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/udf/python/packages-policy). Package policies are not yet supported in the provider.

Reference: [BCR-2120](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/bcr-bundles/2025_07/bcr-2120)

### Disallow GRANT REFERENCE_USAGE on a database if GRANT USAGE isn’t set first

After enabling this BCR, `GRANT USAGE` on a database must be granted before `GRANT REFERENCE_USAGE`. These operations can be combined like `GRANT USAGE, REFERENCE_USAGE`. You can manage these in Terraform with [grant_privileges_to_share](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/grant_privileges_to_share). You may need to adjust your grant configurations.

Additionally, when updating the `accounts` field in the `share` resource, the provider creates a temporary database from the share. Before, it granted only the `USAGE` grant. Since [v2.11.0](./MIGRATION_GUIDE.md#improvement-granting-privileges-on-a-database-during-share-update), it also grants `REFERENCE_USAGE`. If you have trouble updating or creating the `share` resource, update the provider to this version.

Reference: [BCR-2136](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/bcr-bundles/2025_07/bcr-2136)

### Default schedule for data metric functions in views

Setting data metric functions in views is now optional. In the provider, the `data_metric_function` field must be set if `data_metric_schedule` is set. The provider will continue to require setting that field for now. We are treating this relaxation as a missing feature, and we'll adjust it in the future.

Reference: [BCR-2101](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/bcr-bundles/2025_07/bcr-2101)

### New `generation` column in output in SHOW WAREHOUSES

This bundle adds the `generation` column. The values in `resource_constraint` column remain the same. The provider has been adjusted in [v2.10.1](./MIGRATION_GUIDE.md#improvement-handling-show_output-in-warehouses).

Reference: [BCR-2110](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/bcr-bundles/2025_07/bcr-2110)

## [Bundle 2025_06](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/bcr-bundles/2025_06_bundle)

### Changes in authentication policies
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The [BCR-2086](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/bcr-bundles/2025_06/bcr-2086) change has been rolled back from the BCR 2025_04 and was moved to 2025_06.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These changes are addressed in the v2.10.0 version.
> If you use an older version, please upgrade to v2.10.0, or use the instructions below as a workaround.

#### `MFA_AUTHENTICATION_METHODS` property deprecation
##### Change
The `MFA_AUTHENTICATION_METHODS` property is deprecated. Setting the `MFA_AUTHENTICATION_METHODS` property returns an error. The new way of handling authentication methods is with `ENFORCE_MFA_ON_EXTERNAL_AUTHENTICATION` field. Note that the `MFA_AUTHENTICATION_METHODS` is still returned in the `DESCRIBE` output.

##### Provider impact
If you:
- Use the [authentication_policy](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/authentication_policy) resource with `mfa_authentication_methods` field different than Snowflake default, or not set, and
- Have this bundle enabled and
- Use versions before v2.10.0,
The provider can return errors like `invalid property 'mfa_AUTHENTICATION_METHODS' for 'AUTHENTICATION_POLICY'` or `MFA_AUTHENTICATION_METHODS is deprecated`. Also, the provider could cause a permadiff on this field due to incorrect handling.

##### Required changes
Upgrade provider to v2.10.0. This version fixes the permadiff and upgrades the state automatically. For older versions, you can set this field to a Snowflake default with [execute](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/execute) resource.

If you get errors like `MFA_AUTHENTICATION_METHODS is deprecated`, then:
1. Disable the 2025_06 bundle.
1. Remove the `mfa_authentication_methods` field from the configuration.
1. Enable the 2025_06 bundle.
1. If you get a non-empty plan on the `mfa_authentication_methods` (it's still in the state), use the [ignore_changes](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/meta-arguments) attribute.

Additionally, the allowed values for `MFA_ENROLLMENT` are changed: `OPTIONAL` is removed and `REQUIRED_PASSWORD_ONLY` and `REQUIRED_SNOWFLAKE_UI_PASSWORD_ONLY` are added.

Reference: [BCR-2086](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/bcr-bundles/2025_06/bcr-2086), [BCR-2097](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/bcr-bundles/2025_06/bcr-2097)

### Snowflake OAuth authentication: Change in the network policy used for a request from client to Snowflake

This change modifies the behavior of authentication with active network policies. Please verify that your network policy configuration allows connection by the provider after activating this change.

Additionally, this change adds the possibility to assign network policies to External Oauth integrations.

Setting the `network_policy` field in `external_oauth_integration` resource is not yet supported in the provider, and it will be handled in the future. As a workaround, please use the [execute](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/execute) resource.

Reference: [BCR-2094](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/bcr-bundles/2025_06/bcr-2094)

### Snowpark Container Services job service: Retention-time increase

In the provider, the job_service resource forces setting the `ASYNC` option.

Before the change, Snowflake automatically deletes the job service 7 days after completion.

After the change, Snowflake retains job services for 14 days after completion.

In most cases, this change in Snowflake should have no effect on the provider. Optionally, you can manually drop the completed jobs.

## [Bundle 2025_05](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/bcr-bundles/2025_05_bundle)

### Key-pair authentication for Google Cloud accounts in the us-central1 region

Previously, when you used key-pair authentication from a Snowflake account in the Google Cloud us-central1 region, specifying the account by using an account locator with additional segments was supported.

Now, when you use key-pair authentication across all cloud platforms and regions, you must specify the account by using only the account locator without additional segments. See our [Authentication methods](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/guides/authentication_methods) guide for authentication overview in the provider.

Reference: [BCR-2055](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/bcr-bundles/2025_05/bcr-2055)

### File formats and stages: Enforce dependency checks

You can't drop or recreate a file format or stage that has dependent external tables. You also can't alter the location of a stage with dependent external tables. To perform these operations, first drop the dependent external tables manually.

Reference: [BCR-1989](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/bcr-bundles/2025_05/bcr-1989)

## [Bundle 2025_04](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/bcr-bundles/2025_04_bundle)

### `MFA_AUTHENTICATION_METHODS` in authentication policy now only includes `PASSWORD` by default

Previously, the created authentication policies with default `MFA_AUTHENTICATION_METHODS` had both `[PASSWORD, SAML]` values.
In this BCR, the default value is changed to only `PASSWORD`. This can cause a permadiff on the optional `mfa_authentication_methods` field in `authentication_policy` resource.
To address this, you can either specify this attribute in the resource configuration, or use the [ignore_changes](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/meta-arguments#lifecycle) meta argument.

This resource is still in preview, and we are planning to rework it in the near future. Handling of default values will be improved.

Reference: [BCR-1971](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/bcr-bundles/2025_04/bcr-1971)

### Primary role requires stage access during `CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE` command

Creating an external table succeeds only if a user’s primary role has the `USAGE` privilege on the stage referenced in the `snowflake_external_table` resource. If you manage external tables in the provider, please grant the `USAGE` privilege on the relevant stages to the connection role.

Reference: [BCR-1993](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/bcr-bundles/2025_04/bcr-1993)

## [Bundle 2025_03](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/bcr-bundles/2025_03_bundle)

### The `CREATE DATA EXCHANGE LISTING` privilege rename

The `CREATE DATA EXCHANGE LISTING` that is granted on account was changed to just `CREATE LISTING`.
If you are using any of the privilege-granting resources, such as [snowflake_grant_privileges_to_account_role](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/grant_privileges_to_account_role)
to perform no downtime migration, you may want to follow our [resource migration guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/guides/resource_migration).
Basically the steps are:
- Remove the resource from the state
- Adjust it to use the new privilege name, i.e. `CREATE LISTING`
- Re-import the resource into the state (with correct privilege name in the imported identifier)

Reference: [BCR-1926](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/bcr-bundles/2025_03/bcr-1926)

### New maximum size limits for database objects

Max sizes for the few data types were increased.

There are no immediate impacts found on the provider execution.
However, as explained in the [Data type changes](./MIGRATION_GUIDE.md#data-type-changes) section of our migration guide, the provider fills out the data type attributes (like size) if they are not provided by the user.
Sizes of `VARCHAR` and `BINARY` data types (when no size is specified) will continue to use the old defaults in the provider (16MB and 8MB respectively).
If you want to use bigger sizes after enabling the Bundle, please specify them explicitly.

These default values may be changed in the future versions of the provider.

Reference: [BCR-1942](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/bcr-bundles/2025_03/bcr-1942)

### Python UDFs and stored procedures: Stop implicit auto-injection of the psutil package

The `psutil` package is no longer implicitly injected into Python UDFs and stored procedures.
Adjust your configuration to use the `psutil` package explicitly in your Python UDFs and stored procedures, like so:
```terraform
resource "snowflake_procedure_python" "test" {
  packages = ["psutil==5.9.0"]
  # other arguments...
}
```
