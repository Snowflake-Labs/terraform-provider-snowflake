        This form is meant to alert the maintainers to an issue with any of documentation connected with the provider, especially in:
        - Guide on [creating issues](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/CREATING_ISSUES.md) + [FAQ](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/FAQ.md) + [Commonly Known Issues](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/KNOWN_ISSUES.md) - If you would like to create a GitHub issue, please read those in the first order.
        - [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/snowflake/latest) (such as resource and data source documentation, guides and examples).
        - [Project README](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/README.md).
        - [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
        - [Migration Guide](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md).

        Documentation edits are generally a bit less involved, so are often a great entrypoint if you've ever been interested in contributing!
