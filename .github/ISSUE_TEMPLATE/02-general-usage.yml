        This form is meant to be used as a way to report issues connected strictly to the provider usage.
        Here are a few examples of general usage issues:
        - Configurations presented as examples are not working as expected.
        - Help with setting up provider configuration for two different accounts.
        - Poor ergonomics of usage between two closely related resources like stage and external table.
        
        Before submitting, we ask that you first search existing issues (also the closed ones) to see if someone else may have experienced the same issue. 
        This helps to keep all relevant information in one place, including any potential workarounds.
        
        Here's a list of useful links that may help you with your issue:
        - [Guide on creating issues + FAQ + Commonly Known Issues](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/CREATING_ISSUES.md) - If you would like to create a GitHub issue, please read our guide first. It contains useful links, FAQ, and commonly known issues with solutions that may already solve your case.
        - [Migration Guide](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md) - when introducing breaking changes, we note them in the migration guide and describe how to upgrade to the next version. If you recently upgraded the provider version, please check if you applied all the needed changes.

        Here's a list of environment variables you can set for logging additional information:
        - *TF_LOG=DEBUG* - this one is a must-have as it's printing executed SQLs which helps us to see what is happening underneath.
        - *SF_TF_GOSNOWFLAKE_LOG_LEVEL=debug* - if you feel the problem may be connected with the Snowflake driver, please set this one for additional driver logs.
