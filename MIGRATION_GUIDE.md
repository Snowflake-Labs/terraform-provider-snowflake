# Migration guide

This document is meant to help you migrate your Terraform config to the new newest version. In migration guides, we will only
describe deprecations or breaking changes and help you to change your configuration to keep the same (or similar) behavior
across different versions.

To keep your configuration up to date, we also recommend reading the [Snowflake BCR migration guide](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/SNOWFLAKE_BCR_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)
for changes required after enabling given [Snowflake BCR Bundle](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/behavior-changes).

> [!TIP]
> We highly recommend upgrading the versions one by one instead of bulk upgrades.
>
> To migrate particular resources, follow our [Resource Migration](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/guides/resource_migration) guide for more details.
>
> In certain cases (like using the ancient provider versions), you can upgrade multiple versions at once. To do that:
> - read the target version documentation and all the intermediary migration guide entries;
> - focus on changes to authentication to make sure your provider is set up correctly in the newest version;
> - check changes to resource schemas; if in doubt, you can always simplify the resource and let the terraform figure out the changes (you can use plan output to make the configuration appropriate);
> - reimport your infrastructure using the target provider version, preferably in smaller chunks (or experiment with 1-2 resources of each type first).
>
> What should be considered an ancient version?
> The rule of thumb should be: if you are on ~0.85.0 (or close so that you can bump to it), you can follow this guide step by step. If you are on a lower version, import your infrastructure into config using the newest version.

> [!TIP]
> If you're still using the `Snowflake-Labs/snowflake` source, see [Upgrading from Snowflake-Labs Provider](./SNOWFLAKEDB_MIGRATION.md) to upgrade to the snowflakedb namespace.

## v2.20.x ➞ v2.21.0

### *(breaking change)* Renamed constraint column fields in `snowflake_iceberg_table`

Note: this resource is in preview allowing us to make breaking changes without bumping the major version (following [our docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/terraform#preview-features)).

Collections of primitive values in [`snowflake_iceberg_table`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/iceberg_table) now use plural names, aligning with [`snowflake_hybrid_table`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/hybrid_table):

- `primary_key_constraint.column` ➞ `columns`
- `unique_constraint.column` ➞ `columns`
- `foreign_key_constraint.column` ➞ `columns`
- `foreign_key_constraint.ref_column` ➞ `ref_columns`

The top-level `column` block (column definitions) is unchanged.

The old configuration looks like this:
```terraform
  primary_key_constraint {
    column = ["ID"]
  }

  unique_constraint {
    column = ["NAME"]
  }

  foreign_key_constraint {
    column     = ["REF_ID"]
    table_name = "DATABASE.SCHEMA.OTHER_TABLE"
    ref_column = ["ID"]
  }
```

The new configuration looks like this:
```terraform
  primary_key_constraint {
    columns = ["ID"]
  }

  unique_constraint {
    columns = ["NAME"]
  }

  foreign_key_constraint {
    columns     = ["REF_ID"]
    table_name  = "DATABASE.SCHEMA.OTHER_TABLE"
    ref_columns = ["ID"]
  }
```

Please rename these fields in your configuration files. After updating the configuration, `terraform plan` should be empty.

### Multiple resources and data sources promoted to stable

The following resources and data sources are now stable and no longer require the `preview_features_enabled` flag to be
used. Please remove their corresponding entries from the `preview_features_enabled` list in your provider configuration
if present.

**Resources:**

- `snowflake_account_authentication_policy_attachment` (`snowflake_account_authentication_policy_attachment_resource`)
- `snowflake_api_integration_amazon_api_gateway` (`snowflake_api_integration_amazon_api_gateway_resource`)

- `snowflake_api_integration_git_repository_private_link` (`snowflake_api_integration_git_repository_private_link_resource`)
- `snowflake_api_integration_git_repository_token` (`snowflake_api_integration_git_repository_token_resource`)
- `snowflake_api_integration_google_cloud_api_gateway` (`snowflake_api_integration_google_cloud_api_gateway_resource`)
- `snowflake_cortex_agent` (`snowflake_cortex_agent_resource`)
- `snowflake_file_format_avro` (`snowflake_file_format_avro_resource`)
- `snowflake_file_format_csv` (`snowflake_file_format_csv_resource`)
- `snowflake_file_format_json` (`snowflake_file_format_json_resource`)
- `snowflake_file_format_orc` (`snowflake_file_format_orc_resource`)
- `snowflake_file_format_parquet` (`snowflake_file_format_parquet_resource`)
- `snowflake_file_format_xml` (`snowflake_file_format_xml_resource`)
- `snowflake_mcp_server` (`snowflake_mcp_server_resource`)
- `snowflake_storage_lifecycle_policy` (`snowflake_storage_lifecycle_policy_resource`)
- `snowflake_table_storage_lifecycle_policy_attachment` (`snowflake_table_storage_lifecycle_policy_attachment_resource`)
- `snowflake_user_authentication_policy_attachment` (`snowflake_user_authentication_policy_attachment_resource`)
- `snowflake_warehouse_adaptive` (`snowflake_warehouse_adaptive_resource`)

**Data sources:**

- `snowflake_api_integrations` (`snowflake_api_integrations_datasource`)
- `snowflake_cortex_agents` (`snowflake_cortex_agents_datasource`)
- `snowflake_file_formats` (`snowflake_file_formats_datasource`)
- `snowflake_listings` (`snowflake_listings_datasource`)
- `snowflake_mcp_servers` (`snowflake_mcp_servers_datasource`)
- `snowflake_storage_lifecycle_policies` (`snowflake_storage_lifecycle_policies_datasource`)

Provider will issue a warning if a stable feature is still present in the `preview_features_enabled` list. These values
will be removed in the next major version.

Read more about preview and stable features in
our [documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs#support).

### *(new feature)* New hybrid tables data source

We have added a new preview data source for querying hybrid tables: [snowflake_hybrid_tables](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/data-sources/hybrid_tables). It supports filtering with `like`, `in`, `starts_with`, and `limit`.

This feature will be marked as stable in a future release. Breaking changes are expected, even without bumping the major version. To use it, add `snowflake_hybrid_tables_datasource` to the `preview_features_enabled` field in the provider configuration.

No changes are required for existing configurations unless you want to adopt this preview feature with Terraform.

### *(bug fix)* Empty lists in fields with a `none` option crashed the provider

The following fields take a list of names, or `none = true` when nothing should be selected:

- `snowflake_session_policy` - `allowed_secondary_roles` and `blocked_secondary_roles`
- `snowflake_external_access_integration` - `allowed_authentication_secrets` and `allowed_api_authentication_integrations`

Setting the list to `[]` was accepted by `terraform plan`, but crashed the provider during `terraform apply`.

These lists now require at least one item, so an empty list is reported by `terraform plan` instead:

```
Error: Not enough list items

Attribute <field>.0.<list> requires 1 item minimum, but config has only 0
declared.
```

If you would like to specify an empty list, please use `none = true` instead.

### *(bug fix)* `snowflake_storage_lifecycle_policy`: perpetual in-place update of `describe_output`

`snowflake_storage_lifecycle_policy` could produce a non-empty plan on every run even when the configuration was unchanged. The planned change was an in-place update of the computed `describe_output` attribute:

```
  # snowflake_storage_lifecycle_policy.example will be updated in-place
  ~ resource "snowflake_storage_lifecycle_policy" "example" {
      ~ describe_output = [ ... ] -> (known after apply)
    }
```

`terraform apply` succeeded but did not converge: the next plan showed the same diff.

After upgrading, `terraform plan` should be empty for unchanged storage lifecycle policies. If you added `lifecycle { ignore_changes = [describe_output] }` as a workaround, you can remove it.

No other configuration changes are required.

### *(bug fix)* Perpetual in-place update of view, materialized view, and dynamic table statements when identifiers contain spaces

When a quoted object name contained a space (for example a database named `Example Database`), the provider misread the SQL `TEXT` returned by Snowflake. The identifier parser stopped at the first space even though the name was quoted, so `statement` (or `query` for dynamic tables) was stored incorrectly.

Unchanged resources then produced a non-empty plan on every run:

```
  # snowflake_view.example will be updated in-place
  ~ resource "snowflake_view" "example" {
      ~ statement = "..." -> "SELECT 1 AS ID"
    }
```

`terraform apply` succeeded but did not converge: the next plan showed the same diff.

The same parser is used by:

- [`snowflake_view`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/view) (`statement`)
- [`snowflake_materialized_view`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/materialized_view) (`statement`)
- [`snowflake_dynamic_table`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/dynamic_table) (`query`)

After upgrading, `terraform plan` should be empty for unchanged resources. If you added `lifecycle { ignore_changes = [statement] }` or `lifecycle { ignore_changes = [query] }` as a workaround, you can remove it.

No other configuration changes are required.

### *(bug fix)* Importing `snowflake_file_format_csv` no longer fails on hyphenated `ENCODING` aliases

Importing `snowflake_file_format_csv` (and setting `encoding` on CSV stage file format options) failed with `invalid csv encoding: UTF-8` when `DESCRIBE FILE FORMAT` returned a hyphenated alias such as `utf-8` or `UTF-16LE` instead of the canonical `UTF8` / `UTF16LE`. Snowflake accepts IANA-style names, stores the original spelling, and echoes it from `DESCRIBE`, so this permanently blocked importing those objects and migrating them off the deprecated `snowflake_file_format` resource.

`ToCsvEncoding` now maps those aliases to the canonical values (for example `utf-8` → `UTF8`, `UTF-16LE` → `UTF16LE`). Imported and read `encoding` fields, including `describe_output`, are always the canonical uppercase form. Configurations that already use `encoding = "UTF8"` do not need to change; hyphenated values in configuration are also accepted and normalized.

No changes in configuration are required.

## v2.19.x ➞ v2.20.0

### *(new feature)* New hybrid table resource

We have added a new preview resource for managing hybrid tables: [snowflake_hybrid_table](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/hybrid_table). Check the [official Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-hybrid-table) to know more.

This feature will be marked as stable in a future release. Breaking changes are expected, even without bumping the major version. To use it, add `snowflake_hybrid_table_resource` to the `preview_features_enabled` field in the provider configuration.

No changes are required for existing configurations unless you want to adopt this preview feature with Terraform.

### *(new feature)* New external access integration resource and data source

#### Resource

We have added a new preview resource for managing external access integrations: [snowflake_external_access_integration](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/external_access_integration).

This feature will be marked as stable in future releases. To use it, add `snowflake_external_access_integration_resource` to the `preview_features_enabled` field in the provider configuration.

#### Data source

We have added a new preview data source for external access integrations: [snowflake_external_access_integrations](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/data-sources/external_access_integrations). It supports filtering with `like`.

This feature will be marked as stable in future releases. To use it, add `snowflake_external_access_integrations_datasource` to the `preview_features_enabled` field in the provider configuration.

No changes are required for existing configurations unless you want to adopt any of these preview features with Terraform.

### *(new feature)* ACCOUNT_ROLE_SHOW_CACHING experiment

A new `ACCOUNT_ROLE_SHOW_CACHING` experiment has been added. When enabled, the result of looking up
an account role by identifier (`SHOW ROLES LIKE '<name>'`, via the underlying `ShowByID`/
`ShowByIDSafely` calls) is cached in memory for the duration of a single plan or apply cycle, so
multiple resource instances referencing the same role share one round trip instead of each issuing
their own.

Currently supported by: `snowflake_account_role`, `snowflake_grant_application_role`,
`snowflake_grant_privileges_to_account_role`.

Without caching, every lookup of a given role — the role's own `snowflake_account_role` Read, or an
existence check performed by a grant resource before granting to/from it — issues an independent
round trip, even when many resource instances reference the same role. The cache is invalidated on
`snowflake_account_role` Update (rename or comment change) and Delete, since only that resource can
change what a cached lookup would return.

This is a separate, independent flag from `GRANT_ACCOUNT_ROLE_SHOW_CACHING`: it does **not** affect
`snowflake_grant_account_role`'s `SHOW GRANTS OF ROLE` caching, and both can be enabled together.

To enable, add `ACCOUNT_ROLE_SHOW_CACHING` to the `experimental_features_enabled` field in the
provider configuration:

```hcl
provider "snowflake" {
  experimental_features_enabled = ["ACCOUNT_ROLE_SHOW_CACHING"]
}
```

No changes to existing configurations are required. The experiment is intended for large
configurations (thousands of role or grant resources) where plan and apply time is dominated by
redundant role lookups.

### *(new feature)* GRANTS_SHOW_CACHING experiment

A new `GRANTS_SHOW_CACHING` experiment has been added. When enabled, the provider caches `SHOW GRANTS` results (both `SHOW GRANTS ON <object>` and `SHOW FUTURE GRANTS IN <container>`) in memory for the duration of a single plan or apply cycle, so multiple resource instances resolving to the same underlying SHOW statement share one round-trip instead of each issuing their own.

Currently supported by: `snowflake_grant_privileges_to_account_role`, `snowflake_grant_ownership`.

Without caching, every resource instance issues an independent SHOW GRANTS call during Read. In configurations where many grant resources resolve to the same underlying SHOW statement (e.g. many privilege grants on the same schema, or many future-grant roles on the same database), this produces N identical round-trips that each return the same full result set — only 1 is needed per unique statement per plan.

When enabled, the first Read for a given SHOW statement fetches and caches the result; subsequent Reads in the same plan reuse it. The cache is invalidated on Create, Update, and Delete of the resources listed above, and additionally on any grant/revoke/ownership-transfer performed by `snowflake_grant_privileges_to_database_role` and `snowflake_grant_privileges_to_share` that could affect the same object, so mutations within a single apply remain correctly visible to subsequent Reads. As with any cache, a mutation to the same object made *outside* this apply cycle (by another concurrent Terraform run, or a resource type not listed above) is not tracked and cannot invalidate an already-cached entry; this is a pre-existing limitation of the caching model introduced by `GRANT_ACCOUNT_ROLE_SHOW_CACHING` in v2.18.0, not something new to this experiment.

To enable, add `GRANTS_SHOW_CACHING` to the `experimental_features_enabled` field in the provider configuration:

```hcl
provider "snowflake" {
  experimental_features_enabled = ["GRANTS_SHOW_CACHING"]
}
```

This is a separate, independent flag from `GRANT_ACCOUNT_ROLE_SHOW_CACHING`: it does **not** replace that experiment, does not affect `snowflake_grant_account_role`'s caching behavior, and both can be enabled together. No changes to existing configurations are required. The experiment is intended for large configurations (thousands of grant resources) where plan and apply time is dominated by redundant `SHOW GRANTS` calls.

### *(new feature)* tfc_workload_identity_token_tag provider field

A new optional `tfc_workload_identity_token_tag` provider field has been added for use with the OIDC
workload identity flow. Terraform Cloud/Enterprise exposes manually generated workload identity tokens
through environment variables named `TFC_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_TOKEN_<TAG>`; setting this field to the tag
makes the provider read the JWT from the matching variable and use it as the workload identity token:

```terraform
provider "snowflake" {
  organization_name               = "<organization_name>"
  account_name                    = "<account_name>"
  user                            = "<user_name>"
  authenticator                   = "WORKLOAD_IDENTITY"
  workload_identity_provider      = "OIDC"
  tfc_workload_identity_token_tag = "SNOWFLAKE"
}
```

This removes the need for an external data source or a wrapper script, and allows backing the plan and
the apply phase with different Snowflake identities based on the TFC/TFE token claims.

The field requires `authenticator = "WORKLOAD_IDENTITY"` and `workload_identity_provider = "OIDC"`;
other combinations are rejected with an error. The resolved token takes precedence over every other
token source, including the `token` field, `SNOWFLAKE_TOKEN`, and a TOML profile. The tag can also be
sourced from `SNOWFLAKE_TFC_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_TOKEN_TAG`. The untagged `TFC_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_TOKEN`
variable is not read.

Leaving the field unset keeps the existing authentication behavior unchanged. See the
[authentication methods guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/guides/authentication_methods)
for details.

### *(new feature)* `backup_instance_families` added to `snowflake_compute_pool`

The [`snowflake_compute_pool`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/compute_pool) resource now supports the `backup_instance_families` attribute, which maps to the `BACKUP_INSTANCE_FAMILIES` Snowflake property. This attribute specifies instance families to fall back on when the primary `instance_family` is unavailable. It is a list rather than a set, because the order is the fallback priority; values are case-insensitive, and removing the attribute or setting it to an empty list unsets the property. The property is also exposed in `show_output` and `describe_output` of the resource and of the [`snowflake_compute_pools`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/data-sources/compute_pools) data source.

`BACKUP_INSTANCE_FAMILIES` is a [preview feature](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/preview-features) on the Snowflake side. Its behavior may change until it reaches general availability.

In most cases no action is required; this is a non-breaking addition. However, if you set `BACKUP_INSTANCE_FAMILIES` on a compute pool outside of Terraform (e.g. directly in Snowflake) before this release, the provider will now detect it as drift. Because the attribute is not present in your configuration, the next plan will show a change that removes the externally set values. To keep them, add them to the `backup_instance_families` attribute in your configuration.

### *(new feature)* `for_all_person_users` and `for_all_service_users` in account policy attachments

Both `snowflake_account_authentication_policy_attachment` and `snowflake_account_session_policy_attachment` now support attaching a policy to a specific user type via two new mutually-exclusive boolean fields:

- `for_all_person_users` – attaches the policy with `FOR ALL PERSON USERS`.
- `for_all_service_users` – attaches the policy with `FOR ALL SERVICE USERS`.

No configuration changes are needed unless you want to attach a policy to a specific user type. When neither field is set (the default), the policy is attached account-wide, exactly as before. A single account can have one attachment per scope (account-wide, person users, and service users) of the same policy kind at the same time, each managed by a separate resource instance.

### *(new feature)* `ADAPTIVE` refresh mode for dynamic tables

The `snowflake_dynamic_table` resource now accepts [`ADAPTIVE`](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/2026/other/2026-07-30-dynamic-tables-adaptive-refresh-mode-ga) as a valid value for `refresh_mode` option.

No changes in configuration are required unless you want to start using `refresh_mode = "ADAPTIVE"`.

Reference: [#5097](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/5097)

### *(bug fix)* Grant resources and grants data source: support `TABLE(<type>)` data metric function arguments

Previously, managing grants on data metric functions whose signature uses the abbreviated `TABLE(<type>)` form (for example, `"SNOWFLAKE"."CORE"."ACCEPTED_VALUES"(TABLE(DATE))`) caused a provider panic like this
```
Stack trace from the terraform-provider-snowflake_v2.19.0 plugin:

panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference
[signal SIGSEGV: segmentation violation code=0x2 addr=0x0 pc=0x1050294dc]

goroutine 286 [running]:
github.com/Snowflake-Labs/terraform-provider-snowflake/pkg/sdk/datatypes.(*TableDataType).ToLegacyDataTypeSql(0x5454dccfaae0?)
github.com/Snowflake-Labs/terraform-provider-snowflake/pkg/sdk/datatypes/table.go:42 +0x1c
```

This has been fixed: the provider now correctly parses and serializes the abbreviated `TABLE(<type>)` signature in function identifiers.

No changes are required for existing configurations.

References: [#5087](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/5087)


### *(bug fix)* Deprecation warning raised for `skip_toml_file_permission_verification` that was not set

Previously, every `terraform plan` / `terraform apply` raised the `Argument is deprecated` warning for the `skip_toml_file_permission_verification` provider field, even when the field was not set in the provider configuration (once per provider block, so configurations with multiple aliased providers got multiple warnings):

```
│ Warning: Argument is deprecated
│
│   with provider["registry.terraform.io/snowflakedb/snowflake"].sysadmin,
│
│ This field is deprecated. It will be removed in the next major release. Skipping TOML configuration file permission verification will be disallowed in the next major release. (...)
```

The warning was purely cosmetic - the TOML file permission verification itself was not affected. Now the warning is raised only when the field is set explicitly (in the configuration or with the `SNOWFLAKE_SKIP_TOML_FILE_PERMISSION_VERIFICATION` environment variable). The field's effective default is still `false`, so no changes in configuration are required.

Reference: [#5082](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/5082)

### *(bug fix)* Fixed import of the per-type file format resources

Importing `snowflake_file_format_parquet`, `snowflake_file_format_avro`, `snowflake_file_format_orc`, `snowflake_file_format_xml`, `snowflake_file_format_csv`, or `snowflake_file_format_json` (all preview resources) using a config-driven `import` block failed with:

```
Error: Import returned no resources

While attempting to import with ID "...", the providerreturned no instance states.
```

Using the legacy `terraform import <resource> <id>` command did not show this error, but it silently produced an empty resource with no attributes in the state instead of the imported object. Both symptoms had the same root cause: a bug in import logic that misclassified a list of successful (no-op) results as a list of errors. No changes in configuration are required; upgrade the provider and reimport the affected resources.

Reference: [#5086](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/5086)

### *(bug fix)* Importing typed file format resources no longer fails on a non-uppercase `TYPE`

Importing any of the typed file format resources (`snowflake_file_format_avro`, `snowflake_file_format_csv`, `snowflake_file_format_json`, `snowflake_file_format_orc`, `snowflake_file_format_parquet`, `snowflake_file_format_xml`) failed with `invalid file format type, expected PARQUET, got parquet` when the object's `DESCRIBE FILE FORMAT` `TYPE` property was not all-uppercase. Because `TYPE` is immutable in Snowflake, this permanently blocked importing such objects and migrating them off the deprecated `snowflake_file_format` resource. Fixes [#5085](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/5085).

Every enum-valued property returned by `DESCRIBE FILE FORMAT` (`TYPE`, `COMPRESSION`, `BINARY_FORMAT`, and `ENCODING`) is now parsed case-insensitively and normalized to its canonical uppercase form. This also means that these values are always written to `describe_output` (and to the corresponding fields of the `snowflake_stage_*` resources and the `snowflake_file_formats` and `snowflake_stages` data sources) in uppercase, regardless of how Snowflake reports them. If you have such a legacy object, you may see a one-time state change for these fields after upgrading.

Note that an unrecognized value for any of these properties is now reported as an error instead of being passed through verbatim. If you hit this on a value that Snowflake accepts, please report it as a bug — it means the provider's list of allowed values is incomplete.

No changes in configuration are required.

Reference: [#5085](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/5085)

### *(bugfix)* The `SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT` environment variable caused errors without `PROVIDER_CONFIGURATION_ACCOUNT_FALLBACK` experiment being enabled

The [`PROVIDER_CONFIGURATION_ACCOUNT_FALLBACK`](#new-feature-provider_configuration_account_fallback-experiment) experiment added in v2.19.0 re-introduced the `account` field, and using this field without the experiment enabled results in an error. Because the field could also be sourced from the `SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT` environment variable, merely having this variable set (e.g. for other Snowflake tooling running in the same pipeline) was enough to fail the provider configuration with:

```
Error: the account field requires the "PROVIDER_CONFIGURATION_ACCOUNT_FALLBACK" experiment to be enabled; add it to experimental_features_enabled in provider configuration
```

even when the provider configuration set only `organization_name` and `account_name`.

Now, the value of the `SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT` environment variable is used only when the experiment is enabled. Without the experiment, the value is ignored (like before the `account` field was re-introduced) and the following warning is emitted instead of the error above:

```
Warning: The SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT environment variable is ignored.
```

Setting the `account` field in the provider configuration or in a TOML profile still requires the experiment.

The warning is intentional: the experiment will be enabled by default in v3, and from that version on `SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT` will be used as a fallback for `organization_name` and `account_name` (which take precedence over it). If your account currently comes from a TOML profile and the variable points to a different account, this will change the account you connect to.

No changes in the configuration are required. To silence the warning, either unset `SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT` for the Terraform run, or enable the experiment now to verify the behavior you will get in v3.

### *(bug fix)* Fixed parsing DESC results in Iceberg Table resources

Previously, reading an Iceberg table with the `snowflake_iceberg_table` and other resources failed whenever one of its columns had a structured data type with attributes that the provider does not model, for example `OBJECT`, `ARRAY`, or `MAP`. The underlying `DESC ICEBERG TABLE` output could not be parsed for such columns, which broke `terraform plan`/`refresh` for any table containing them.

Now, a column type that cannot be parsed no longer fails the whole describe call; the provider falls back to the raw type string reported by Snowflake for that column. No changes in configuration are required.

References: [#5090](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/5090)

### *(bug fix)* Fixed handling of unprefixed database role grantee names in `SHOW GRANTS` (2026_06 bundle / BCR-2371)

Previously, when a database role was granted to another database role, the provider expected the `SHOW GRANTS OF DATABASE ROLE` output to return the grantee database role as a fully qualified name (`<database>.<database_role>`). The 2026_06 bundle (BCR-2371) changes this output so that the grantee database role is returned without the database prefix (just `<database_role>`). With the bundle enabled, the provider could not parse the grantee name, so the Read operation of the `snowflake_grant_database_role` resource failed to find the grant and marked the resource as deleted. `terraform plan` then showed a permanent diff recreating the grant, and `terraform apply` returned an error like

```
│ Error: Provider produced inconsistent result after apply

│ When applying changes to snowflake_grant_database_role.example, provider "provider[\"registry.terraform.io/snowflakedb/snowflake\"]" produced an unexpected new value: Root object was present, but now absent.
│
│ This is a bug in the provider, which should be reported in the provider's own issue tracker.
```

Importing such a resource failed for the same reason (`Cannot import non-existent remote object`).

In this release, the grantee database role name is normalized to a fully qualified identifier regardless of whether the bundle is enabled: when the database prefix is missing, it is reconstructed from the database of the queried database role (a database role can only be granted to another database role in the same database). The `snowflake_grant_database_role` resource is no longer recreated on every plan and can be imported again.

### *(known issue)* `snowflake_procedure_python` and `snowflake_function_python` fail to read state correctly after BCR-2325 (default package source change for Snowpark Python)

Starting June 26, 2026, Snowflake can implicitly attach an artifact repository to a Python procedure or function and resolve its packages from a shared PyPI repository instead of Anaconda. When this happens, `snowflake_procedure_python` fails on `terraform plan`/`apply` with `could not parse package from Snowflake, expected at least snowpark package`, and `snowflake_function_python` silently reports an empty `packages` list in state (with no error), because the provider does not yet parse the new `artifact_repository_packages` property returned by `DESCRIBE PROCEDURE`/`DESCRIBE FUNCTION`.

See [Default package source changes for Snowpark Python break `snowflake_procedure_python` and `snowflake_function_python`](./SNOWFLAKE_BCR_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md#default-package-source-changes-for-snowpark-python-break-snowflake_procedure_python-and-snowflake_function_python) in the BCR Migration Guide for the trigger conditions and workarounds.

### *(bug fix)* `snowflake_warehouse`: perpetual `min_cluster_count` / `max_cluster_count` `0 → 1` drift on Standard edition

On Standard edition (when multi-cluster warehouses are not enabled), `SHOW WAREHOUSES` omits the `min_cluster_count` and `max_cluster_count` columns. Starting in v2.18.0, those omitted columns were scanned as unset and then treated as an external change, so every plan reported an in-place update even when the configuration already set both values to `1` (the Snowflake minimum and the provider's validation minimum):

```
  # snowflake_warehouse.example will be updated in-place
  ~ resource "snowflake_warehouse" "example" {
      ~ max_cluster_count = 0 -> 1
      ~ min_cluster_count = 0 -> 1
      ~ show_output       = [ ... ] -> (known after apply)
    }
```

`terraform apply` succeeded but did not converge: the next plan showed the same `0 → 1` diff.

The provider now treats an omitted `SHOW` integer as `0`, matching the zero already stored in `show_output`, so a config value of `1` is no longer overwritten. After upgrading, `terraform plan` should be empty for Standard-edition warehouses that set `min_cluster_count` and `max_cluster_count` to `1`. If you added `lifecycle { ignore_changes = [min_cluster_count, max_cluster_count] }` as a workaround, you can remove it.

The same mapping is used by `snowflake_warehouse_interactive`. No other configuration changes are required.

### *(improvement)* `created_on` format in network policies' and listings' `show_output`

`created_on` in the internal network policy and listing representations was a raw string; it is now read as a proper timestamp, making both consistent with databases, warehouses, schemas, shares, resource monitors, connections, and compute pools, which all already exposed it that way.

As a result, the value of `show_output.0.created_on` is now rendered in Go's timestamp format (the same format the objects listed above already use) instead of the format returned directly by `SHOW NETWORK POLICIES` / `SHOW LISTINGS`, in:

- `snowflake_network_policy` and `snowflake_network_policies`
- `snowflake_listing` and `snowflake_listings`

`created_on` in listings' `describe_output` is unaffected and remains in its original format.

No configuration changes are required. Adjust only if you reference `show_output.0.created_on` and depend on its exact textual format.

## v2.18.x ➞ v2.19.0

### *(improvement)* Rework of `snowflake_account_authentication_policy_attachment` and `snowflake_user_authentication_policy_attachment`

Both resources have been reworked to follow the modern resource patterns used in this provider.

#### `snowflake_account_authentication_policy_attachment`

- **`authentication_policy` no longer forces recreation.** Previously, changing this field destroyed and recreated the resource. It is now changed in-place — the old policy is unset and the new one is set without destroying the resource. Existing configurations do not need to change; future policy changes will produce an `update` plan instead of a `destroy`+`create` plan.
- **Active drift detection.** Previously, changes to the policy made outside Terraform were not detected. Now, the provider queries Snowflake to verify the actual attached policy on every plan. If the policy was changed or removed outside Terraform, the next `terraform plan` will detect it as drift.
- **ID format change.** The internal resource ID has changed from the legacy pipe-separated format (`database|schema|policy_name`) to the fully qualified name format (`"database"."schema"."policy_name"`). The state is migrated automatically on the next `terraform plan` or `terraform apply` — no manual action is required.


#### `snowflake_user_authentication_policy_attachment`

- **`authentication_policy_name` no longer forces recreation.** Previously, changing either `user_name` or `authentication_policy_name` destroyed and recreated the resource. Now `authentication_policy_name` can be changed in-place — the old policy is unset and the new one is set without recreating the resource. Changing `user_name` still forces recreation, since a different user is a fundamentally different attachment.

### *(fix)* `snowflake_network_rules` data source promoted to stable

The `snowflake_network_rules` data source was accidentally left out of the stable promotion in v2.17.0 when `snowflake_network_rule` resource was promoted. It is now correctly promoted to stable.

The following data source is now stable and no longer requires the `preview_features_enabled` flag: `snowflake_network_rules` (`snowflake_network_rules_datasource`).

Provider will issue a warning if a stable feature is still present in the `preview_features_enabled` list. These values will be removed in the next major version.

Read more about preview and stable features in our [documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs#support).


### *(bug fix)* `snowflake_storage_integration_aws` and `snowflake_storage_integration_azure` import fix

Previously, after importing `snowflake_storage_integration_aws` or `snowflake_storage_integration_azure` (for example, when migrating from the older `snowflake_storage_integration` resource), the next `terraform plan` showed an unavoidable diff trying to unset `storage_aws_external_id` (AWS only) and modify `use_privatelink_endpoint` (AWS and Azure) when you did not set these fields in your configuration.

- `storage_aws_external_id` (AWS only): the diff is now gone. No action is required beyond reimporting the affected resources with the new provider version.
- `use_privatelink_endpoint` (AWS and Azure): the diff is fixed behind the `IMPORT_BOOLEAN_DEFAULT` experiment. To get the fix, add it to the provider configuration and reimport the affected resources. Without the flag, the behavior stays the same as in previous versions.

### Enhanced file format support
#### *(new feature)* New file format resources

We have added new preview resources for file formats:
- [snowflake_file_format_avro](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/file_format_avro) for managing AVRO file formats ([Snowflake docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-file-format)), must be enabled by `snowflake_file_format_avro_resource` feature name.
- [snowflake_file_format_csv](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/file_format_csv) for managing CSV file formats ([Snowflake docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-file-format)), must be enabled by `snowflake_file_format_csv_resource` feature name.
- [snowflake_file_format_json](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/file_format_json) for managing JSON file formats ([Snowflake docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-file-format)), must be enabled by `snowflake_file_format_json_resource` feature name.
- [snowflake_file_format_orc](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/file_format_orc) for managing ORC file formats ([Snowflake docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-file-format)), must be enabled by `snowflake_file_format_orc_resource` feature name.
- [snowflake_file_format_parquet](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/file_format_parquet) for managing Parquet file formats ([Snowflake docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-file-format)), must be enabled by `snowflake_file_format_parquet_resource` feature name.
- [snowflake_file_format_xml](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/file_format_xml) for managing XML file formats ([Snowflake docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-file-format)), must be enabled by `snowflake_file_format_xml_resource` feature name.

These features will be marked as stable in future releases. To use them, add the relevant feature name to the `preview_features_enabled` field in the provider configuration.

#### *(deprecation)* `snowflake_file_format` resource deprecated

Following the introduction of the new file format resources described above, the existing [`snowflake_file_format`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/file_format) resource has been deprecated. It will be removed in a future major version release.

The old resource handled every file format type with one schema containing the fields of all types, which made the configuration error-prone. Each new resource manages a single type, so its schema contains only the fields valid for that type, and it adheres to our [new conventions](#general-changes).

Please migrate to the resource matching the `type` of your file format.

Notes when migrating:
- the `type` field is only used to detect external changes in the new resources, as each of them manages a single type;
- each new resource's schema contains only the fields valid for the given type;
- non-settable attributes were moved to `show_output` and `describe_output`;
- to achieve zero-downtime migration, please follow our [Resource migration guide](./docs/guides/resource_migration.md).

No immediate action is required - the deprecated resource still works, but you will see a deprecation warning in the plan output until you migrate.

#### *(breaking change, new feature)* Changes in `snowflake_file_formats` data source

As a part of the file format redesign (see [New file format resources](#new-feature-new-file-format-resources)), we reworked the `snowflake_file_formats` data source with the following:
- Moved the required `database` and `schema` fields to the optional `in` block (breaking change). See the before/after examples below.
- Added support for `IN ACCOUNT`, `IN DATABASE`, and `LIKE` filtering.
- Added support for getting data with `DESCRIBE FILE FORMAT` - see the `with_describe` field.
- Changed the output format returned by the data source (breaking change). See the before/after examples below.

With added support for the `IN ACCOUNT` and `IN DATABASE` filters, we nested the `database` and `schema` fields in a separate `in` block and made all these fields optional. For example, please adjust the configurations from:
```terraform
data "snowflake_file_formats" "current" {
  database = "MYDB"
  schema   = "MYSCHEMA"
}
```
to
```terraform
data "snowflake_file_formats" "current" {
  in {
    schema = "MYDB.MYSCHEMA"
  }
}
```

The output format is also changed. Now, all data is nested in `file_formats.show_output`, and in `file_formats.describe_output` if `with_describe` is set to `true` (default). The previously returned `name`, `database`, `schema`, `comment`, and `format_type` fields are gone; use `show_output.0.name`, `show_output.0.database_name`, `show_output.0.schema_name`, `show_output.0.comment`, and `show_output.0.type` instead.

Because `DESCRIBE FILE FORMAT` returns a different set of properties for every file format type, `describe_output` contains a union of the properties of all the file format types; only the fields applicable to the given file format's type are filled (the remaining ones have zero values).

Before:

```terraform
output "simple_output" {
  value = data.snowflake_file_formats.test.file_formats[0].name
}
```
After:

```terraform
output "simple_output" {
  value = data.snowflake_file_formats.test.file_formats[0].show_output[0].name
}

output "describe_output" {
  value = data.snowflake_file_formats.test.file_formats[0].describe_output[0].field_delimiter # Filled only for CSV file formats.
}
```

Please read the [documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/data-sources/file_formats) for more information.

Note that the `snowflake_file_formats` data source is still in preview and requires the `snowflake_file_formats_datasource` feature name in the `preview_features_enabled` field in the provider configuration.

### *(new feature)* `aws_sns_topic` added to `snowflake_stage_external_s3` directory table options

The [`snowflake_stage_external_s3`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/stage_external_s3) resource now supports the `aws_sns_topic` attribute inside the `directory` block. It specifies the AWS SNS topic ARN used to trigger automatic directory table refreshes. This attribute is S3-specific (not available on S3-compatible stages) and causes resource recreation when changed (`ForceNew`).

In most cases no action is required; this is a non-breaking addition. Note that external change detection for this field is not yet supported and will be addressed in a future update.

### *(new feature)* Support for `SNOWFLAKE INTELLIGENCE` and `INTERACTIVE TABLE` object types in grant resources

The [`snowflake_grant_privileges_to_account_role`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/grant_privileges_to_account_role), [`snowflake_grant_privileges_to_database_role`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/grant_privileges_to_database_role), and [`snowflake_grant_ownership`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/grant_ownership) resources now support additional object types:

- `SNOWFLAKE INTELLIGENCE` — an account-level object supporting `MODIFY` and `USAGE` privileges.
- `INTERACTIVE TABLE` — a schema-level object supporting `SELECT` and `REFERENCES` privileges, including bulk grants on ALL/FUTURE interactive tables.

The [`snowflake_tag_association`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/tag_association) resource now also supports `INTERACTIVE TABLE` as a valid `object_type`.

No changes in configuration are required for existing resources; this is a non-breaking addition.

### *(new preview resource)* New interactive warehouse resource

We have added a new preview resource for managing interactive warehouses: [snowflake_warehouse_interactive](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/warehouse_interactive) ([Snowflake docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/warehouses-interactive)).

This feature will be marked as stable in future releases. To use it, add `snowflake_warehouse_interactive_resource` to the `preview_features_enabled` field in the provider configuration.

Interactive warehouses behave differently from standard warehouses in a few ways that are described in the [resource documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/warehouse_interactive).

The `show_output` field in the `snowflake_warehouses` data source now includes an additional computed `tables` attribute surfacing interactive warehouse table associations, and the `parameters` field now includes the `fallback_warehouse` parameter.

No changes are required for existing configurations unless you want to adopt this preview feature with Terraform.

### *(new feature)* Inherited grants support

This release adds support for [inherited grants](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/inherited-grants-using) across the grants data source and the account role grant resource. Inherited grants collapse the common `GRANT ON ALL` + `GRANT ON FUTURE` pattern into a single grant that automatically covers all current and future objects of a type in a container.

Inherited grants are a [preview feature](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/preview-features) on the Snowflake side. They must be enabled on your account before use, and their behavior may change until they reach general availability.

#### Data source

The [`snowflake_grants`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/data-sources/grants) data source now supports listing inherited grants:

- A new `inherited_grants_in` query block was added. It maps to the `SHOW INHERITED GRANTS IN { ACCOUNT | DATABASE <name> | SCHEMA <name> }` command and enumerates the inherited grants defined in a container.
- Each element of the computed `grants` list now additionally exposes the `is_inherited`, `inherited_from`, `inherited_from_database`, and `inherited_from_schema` attributes.

#### Resources

The [`snowflake_grant_privileges_to_account_role`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/grant_privileges_to_account_role) resource now supports creating inherited grants. A new `inherited` block was added to the `on_account_object`, `on_schema`, and `on_schema_object` blocks.

The [`snowflake_grant_privileges_to_database_role`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/grant_privileges_to_database_role) resource now supports creating inherited grants as well:
- `on_schema` gains an `inherited` attribute. It takes the fully qualified name of a database and works just like the existing `all_schemas_in_database` and `future_schemas_in_database` attributes.
- `on_schema_object` gains an `inherited` block that targets a plural object type in a chosen database (`in_database`) or schema (`in_schema`).

Notes (both resources):
- Using an `inherited` block requires enabling the `INHERITED_GRANTS` experiment (add it to the `experimental_features_enabled` list in the provider configuration). Without the experiment, using an `inherited` block results in an error.
- External drift is detected for inherited grants (e.g. an externally revoked privilege reappears in the plan).
- `with_grant_option` is not supported together with an `inherited` block, because inherited grants do not support the `WITH GRANT OPTION` clause.
- `always_apply` is not supported together with an `inherited` block. Inherited grants already cover all current and future objects in the container, so re-granting on every apply is unnecessary.

All changes are non-breaking and additive; no action is required unless you want to adopt inherited grants.

### *(new feature)* PROVIDER_CONFIGURATION_ACCOUNT_FALLBACK experiment

A new `PROVIDER_CONFIGURATION_ACCOUNT_FALLBACK` experiment has been added. When enabled, the `account` field is available as a fallback for `organization_name` and `account_name` in both the provider configuration and TOML profiles.

Previously, the provider required both `organization_name` and `account_name` to be set. With this experiment, you can set `account` as a single-field alternative. The field accepts both the `org-name` format (e.g. `"myorg-myaccount"`) and an account locator (e.g. `"xy12345"`). If both `organization_name` and `account_name` are set, they take precedence.

Without this experiment, using the `account` field (in provider config or TOML) results in an error directing you to enable the experiment.

To enable, add `PROVIDER_CONFIGURATION_ACCOUNT_FALLBACK` to your provider's `experimental_features_enabled` list:
```hcl
provider "snowflake" {
  experimental_features_enabled = ["PROVIDER_CONFIGURATION_ACCOUNT_FALLBACK"]
  account = "myorg-myaccount"
}
```

### *(new feature)* AUTHENTICATOR_EXPLICIT_ONLY experiment

A new `AUTHENTICATOR_EXPLICIT_ONLY` experiment has been added. When enabled, the provider no longer implicitly derives the `authenticator` value from other configuration fields.

Previously, the provider automatically set `authenticator` to `OAUTH` when `token` or `token_accessor` was configured, even if `authenticator` was not explicitly set. This implicit behavior is confusing and scheduled for removal in v3.

With this experiment enabled, the `authenticator` field must be set explicitly in the provider configuration or TOML profile. The `SNOWFLAKE` default (when no authenticator is configured anywhere) is preserved.

To enable, add `AUTHENTICATOR_EXPLICIT_ONLY` to your provider's `experimental_features_enabled` list:
```hcl
provider "snowflake" {
  experimental_features_enabled = ["AUTHENTICATOR_EXPLICIT_ONLY"]
}
```

If you currently rely on the implicit token→OAuth derivation, add `authenticator = "OAUTH"` explicitly to your provider configuration before enabling this experiment.

### *(new feature)* OBJECT_PARAMETER_UNSET_ON_DELETE experiment

A new `OBJECT_PARAMETER_UNSET_ON_DELETE` experiment has been added. When enabled, deleting a `snowflake_object_parameter` resource uses `ALTER <OBJECT_TYPE> <identifier> UNSET <PARAMETER>` instead of resetting the parameter to its default value.

Previously, the provider fetched the parameter's default and explicitly set it back on delete.
This was fragile - it required a working default value lookup, had workarounds for parameters where the default isn't settable (e.g. `REPLICABLE_WITH_FAILOVER_GROUPS`),
and didn't truly remove the object-level override.
With this experiment, the parameter is properly unset, allowing the inherited value from the higher hierarchy level (account → database → schema) to take effect.

To enable, add `OBJECT_PARAMETER_UNSET_ON_DELETE` to your provider's `experimental_features_enabled` list:
```hcl
provider "snowflake" {
  experimental_features_enabled = ["OBJECT_PARAMETER_UNSET_ON_DELETE"]
}
```

### *(new feature)* `issuer` added to `default_workload_identity.aws` on `snowflake_service_user` and `snowflake_legacy_service_user`

The `default_workload_identity.aws` nested block on the [`snowflake_service_user`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/service_user) and [`snowflake_legacy_service_user`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/legacy_service_user) resources now supports an optional `issuer` attribute, which maps to the `ISSUER` parameter of Snowflake's `WORKLOAD_IDENTITY` user property. It is required when configuring JWT-based (`GetWebIdentityToken`) AWS workload identity federation; existing configurations using only `arn` (the `GetCallerIdentity` attestation method) continue to work unchanged.

This is a non-breaking, additive change; no action is required unless you want to adopt JWT-based AWS workload identity federation.

### *(new feature)* Support for future and bulk grants on `WORKSPACES`

Both `snowflake_grant_privileges_to_account_role` and `snowflake_grant_privileges_to_database_role` resources now support `WORKSPACES` in `on_schema_object.all.object_type_plural` and `on_schema_object.future.object_type_plural` fields. The `snowflake_grant_ownership` resource also supports `WORKSPACES` for bulk ownership transfers.

Previously, `WORKSPACES` was only supported for individual object grants (`on_schema_object.object_type`).

No changes to existing configurations are required.

References: [#5004](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/5004).

### *(new feature)* Adding missing compute pool parameters

The following changes add support for managing default compute pool parameters for Notebooks and Streamlit apps:

**`snowflake_account_parameter`** now supports:
- `DEFAULT_NOTEBOOK_COMPUTE_POOL_CPU`
- `DEFAULT_NOTEBOOK_COMPUTE_POOL_GPU`
- `DEFAULT_STREAMLIT_COMPUTE_POOL`

**`snowflake_current_account`** now supports:
- `default_streamlit_compute_pool` — specifies the default compute pool for container-runtime Streamlit apps

**`snowflake_database`**, **`snowflake_secondary_database`**, **`snowflake_shared_database`**, and **`snowflake_schema`** now support:
- `default_notebook_compute_pool_cpu` — sets the preferred CPU compute pool for Notebooks
- `default_notebook_compute_pool_gpu` — sets the preferred GPU compute pool for Notebooks

No changes to existing configurations are required.

References: [#5048](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/5048).

### *(new feature)* `allowed_roles_list` added to OAuth security integrations

The [`snowflake_oauth_integration_for_custom_clients`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/oauth_integration_for_custom_clients) and [`snowflake_oauth_integration_for_partner_applications`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/oauth_integration_for_partner_applications) resources now support the `allowed_roles_list` attribute, which maps to the `ALLOWED_ROLES_LIST` Snowflake property. This attribute specifies Snowflake roles that a user can explicitly consent to using after authenticating. It can only be set when `oauth_use_secondary_roles` is `NONE` (the Snowflake default).

In most cases no action is required; this is a non-breaking addition. However, if you set `ALLOWED_ROLES_LIST` on the integration outside of Terraform (e.g. directly in Snowflake) before this release, the provider will now detect it as drift. Because the attribute is not present in your configuration, the next plan will show a change that removes the externally set roles. To keep them, add the roles to the `allowed_roles_list` attribute in your configuration.

### *(new feature)* New Iceberg Table resources and data source

We have added new preview resources for Iceberg tables:
- [snowflake_iceberg_table_from_rest](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/iceberg_table_from_rest) for managing Snowflake Iceberg Tables created from a REST catalog ([Snowflake docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-iceberg-table-rest)),
- [snowflake_iceberg_table_from_aws_glue](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/iceberg_table_from_aws_glue) for managing Snowflake Iceberg Tables whose metadata is managed by an AWS Glue catalog ([Snowflake docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-iceberg-table-aws-glue)),
- [snowflake_iceberg_table](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/iceberg_table) for managing Snowflake-managed Iceberg Tables, including columns and table-level constraints ([Snowflake docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-iceberg-table-snowflake)),

We have also added a new preview data source:
- [snowflake_iceberg_tables](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/data-sources/iceberg_tables) for querying Iceberg Tables with filters (`like`, `in`, `starts_with`, `limit`) and aggregated SHOW, DESCRIBE, and SHOW PARAMETERS output.

These features will be marked as stable in future releases. To use them, add the relevant feature name (`snowflake_iceberg_table`, `snowflake_iceberg_table_from_rest`, `snowflake_iceberg_table_from_aws_glue`, or `snowflake_iceberg_tables_datasource`) to the `preview_features_enabled` field in the provider configuration.

Stay tuned for the next variants of Iceberg Tables support in the provider!

### *(improvement)* snowflake_grant_account_role SHOW GRANTS caching no longer serializes parallel reads

The experimental `GRANT_ACCOUNT_ROLE_SHOW_CACHING` feature previously held a single global lock for the entire duration of each `SHOW GRANTS OF ROLE` lookup on a cache miss. This serialized first-time lookups for *different* roles behind one another, negating Terraform's parallel resource reads and, in low-cache-reuse topologies, making plans noticeably slower than with caching disabled. Cache lookups are now deduplicated per role: concurrent misses on the same role still share a single round-trip, while misses on different roles run in parallel. No configuration changes are required.

### *(new feature)* New MCP server resource and data source

We have added new preview support for managing and querying MCP servers:
- [snowflake_mcp_server](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/mcp_server) resource for managing MCP servers.
- [snowflake_mcp_servers](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/data-sources/mcp_servers) data source for listing and filtering MCP servers using `SHOW MCP SERVERS` and `DESCRIBE MCP SERVER` output.

These features will be marked as stable in future releases. To use them, add `snowflake_mcp_server_resource` and/or `snowflake_mcp_servers_datasource` to the `preview_features_enabled` field in the provider configuration.

### *(adjustment)* `show_output.partition_specs` on Iceberg table resources is now a structured list

The `partition_specs` field in the `show_output` of the Iceberg table resources (e.g. `snowflake_iceberg_table_from_rest`, `snowflake_iceberg_table_from_aws_glue`) was previously a plain string containing raw JSON. It is now a list of objects, each with `spec_id` and `fields` (containing `name`, `transform`, `source_id`, and `field_id`), making the partition spec directly accessible without parsing JSON.

If you have existing state with the old string-based `partition_specs`, refresh the resource (e.g. `terraform apply` or `terraform refresh`) to update it to the new format. No changes to your resource configuration are required, as `partition_specs` is a computed, read-only field.

### *(bug fix)* `snowflake_external_volume` no longer removes and re-adds unchanged storage locations

Previously, adding a new `storage_location` block to an existing [`snowflake_external_volume`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/external_volume) (or making other partial changes to the `storage_location` list) could cause the provider to unnecessarily issue `ALTER EXTERNAL VOLUME ... REMOVE STORAGE_LOCATION` for an existing, unchanged location before re-adding it. If that location was active (e.g. backing an Iceberg table), Snowflake correctly rejected the removal with error 393926 (42601), blocking the update. The provider now correctly detects unchanged locations and leaves them untouched, issuing only the `ADD`/`REMOVE` operations required for the actual diff.

No changes in configuration are required.

Note that this error can still legitimately occur if your configuration change actually removes the currently active storage location (e.g. removing the block from your configuration, or renaming/replacing it). This is expected Snowflake behavior, not a bug: an active storage location cannot be removed while it is in use (e.g. by an Iceberg table). Reassign the dependent objects to another storage location before removing it from your configuration.

### *(deprecation)* `SkipTomlFilePermissionVerification` configuration attribute deprecated

`skip_toml_file_permission_verification` was used to bypass TOML configuration file permission verification. Skipping TOML configuration file permission verification will be disallowed in the next major release. It's still allowed to set this attribute on the provider configuration side and it still has effect, but:
- it will be removed with the next major release;
- skipping the permission verification will be disallowed.

No changes are required, but because `skip_toml_file_permission_verification` attribute will be removed in the next major version, you can safely remove it, to reduce the number of required changes in the next major provider release. Before removing the flag, make sure the TOML configuration file permissions are set correctly (see the [TOML file limitations](#toml-file-limitations) section in the provider documentation).

### *(new feature)* `resource_monitor` field in `snowflake_warehouse_adaptive`

Added a new optional `resource_monitor` field to the [`snowflake_warehouse_adaptive`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/warehouse_adaptive) resource, mirroring the field already available in [`snowflake_warehouse`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/warehouse). It specifies the name of a resource monitor explicitly assigned to the adaptive warehouse, and it is set on `CREATE WAREHOUSE` and set/unset on `ALTER WAREHOUSE`.

No changes in configuration are required. To start managing the assigned resource monitor, add the field to your configuration:

```terraform
resource "snowflake_warehouse_adaptive" "example" {
  name             = "example"
  resource_monitor = "my_resource_monitor"
}
```

Note that `snowflake_warehouse_adaptive` is still a preview resource, so it requires `snowflake_warehouse_adaptive_resource` in the provider's `preview_features_enabled` list.

Provider will issue a warning if a stable feature is still present in the `preview_features_enabled` list. These values will be removed in the next major version.

Read more about preview and stable features in our [documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs#support).

### *(new feature)* A new experiment for handling renames in object hierarchy

A new `HIERARCHY_RENAMES` experiment has been added. When enabled, changing the parent identifier fields (`database` on `snowflake_schema`, or `database`/`schema` on `snowflake_table`) no longer forces resource recreation. Instead, the provider detects whether a parent was renamed or the object should be moved, and handles it in-place.

Currently supported by: [`snowflake_schema`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/schema), [`snowflake_table`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/table).

The provider handles the following use cases:

**2-level hierarchy** (e.g. `snowflake_schema`):
1. **Database rename**: The parent database was renamed (e.g. from `A` to `B`). The provider detects that the old database no longer exists while the schema already exists under the new name, and updates the resource ID without performing any Snowflake modification.
2. **Schema move**: Both the old and new databases exist. The provider executes `ALTER SCHEMA A.X RENAME TO B.X` to move the schema to the target database.

**3-level hierarchy** (e.g. `snowflake_table`):
- When only the `database` field changes, the provider applies the same rename/move logic at the database level.
- When only the `schema` field changes, the provider applies the same rename/move logic at the schema level.
- When both `database` and `schema` change simultaneously, the provider evaluates all combinations of database and schema existence to determine the correct action (e.g. both were renamed, or one was renamed while the other was moved).

To enable, add `HIERARCHY_RENAMES` to your provider's `experimental_features_enabled` list:
```hcl
provider "snowflake" {
  experimental_features_enabled = ["HIERARCHY_RENAMES"]
}
```

Example configuration using implicit dependencies (recommended):
```hcl
resource "snowflake_database" "example" {
  name = "my_database"
}

resource "snowflake_schema" "example" {
  name     = "my_schema"
  database = snowflake_database.example.name
}

resource "snowflake_table" "example" {
  name     = "my_table"
  database = snowflake_database.example.name
  schema   = snowflake_schema.example.name

  column {
    name = "id"
    type = "NUMBER(38,0)"
  }
}
```

With the experiment enabled, renaming `snowflake_database.example` from `my_database` to `my_new_database` will cause both the schema and table resources to detect the rename and update their state accordingly — without recreating the objects or losing any data within them.

For more details, see the [Object Renaming Guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/guides/object_renaming_guide).

### *(new feature)* New Postgres instance resource

We have added a new preview resource for managing Postgres instances: [snowflake_postgres_instance](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/postgres_instance).

This feature will be marked as stable in a future release. To use it, add `snowflake_postgres_instance_resource` to the `preview_features_enabled` field in the provider configuration.

### *(new feature/deprecation)* API integration resources reworked

#### *(new feature/deprecation)* API integration resources

The existing `snowflake_api_integration` resource has been deprecated. It has been split into nine new dedicated resources, each managing a single integration type:

- [`snowflake_api_integration_amazon_api_gateway`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/api_integration_amazon_api_gateway) — for AWS API Gateway, AWS Private API Gateway, AWS GovCloud API Gateway, and AWS GovCloud Private API Gateway
- [`snowflake_api_integration_azure_api_management`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/api_integration_azure_api_management) — for Azure API Management
- [`snowflake_api_integration_google_cloud_api_gateway`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/api_integration_google_cloud_api_gateway) — for Google Cloud API Gateway
- [`snowflake_api_integration_git_repository_github_app`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/api_integration_git_repository_github_app) — for Git repositories using GitHub App authentication
- [`snowflake_api_integration_git_repository_oauth2`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/api_integration_git_repository_oauth2) — for Git repositories using OAuth 2.0
- [`snowflake_api_integration_git_repository_token`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/api_integration_git_repository_token) — for Git repositories using token-based authentication
- [`snowflake_api_integration_git_repository_private_link`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/api_integration_git_repository_private_link) — for Git repositories over a private link endpoint
- [`snowflake_api_integration_external_mcp_oauth2`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/api_integration_external_mcp_oauth2) — for external MCP servers using OAuth 2.0
- [`snowflake_api_integration_external_mcp_dynamic_client`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/api_integration_external_mcp_dynamic_client) — for external MCP servers using OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration

The newly introduced resources are aligned with the latest Snowflake documentation at the time of implementation. Each resource schema contains only the attributes valid for the given integration type.

These resources are in preview. To use them, add the corresponding feature flag(s) to the [`preview_features_enabled`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs#preview_features_enabled-1) provider field:
- `snowflake_api_integration_amazon_api_gateway_resource`
- `snowflake_api_integration_azure_api_management_resource`
- `snowflake_api_integration_google_cloud_api_gateway_resource`
- `snowflake_api_integration_git_repository_github_app_resource`
- `snowflake_api_integration_git_repository_oauth2_resource`
- `snowflake_api_integration_git_repository_token_resource`
- `snowflake_api_integration_git_repository_private_link_resource`
- `snowflake_api_integration_external_mcp_oauth2_resource`
- `snowflake_api_integration_external_mcp_dynamic_client_resource`

The old `snowflake_api_integration` resource is deprecated and will be removed in a future major version. It remains available in the meantime.

##### Migrating from `snowflake_api_integration` to the new resources

To determine which new resource to use, check the `api_provider` value in your existing `snowflake_api_integration` configuration:

| Old `api_provider` value | New resource |
|---|---|
| `aws_api_gateway` | `snowflake_api_integration_amazon_api_gateway` |
| `aws_private_api_gateway` | `snowflake_api_integration_amazon_api_gateway` |
| `aws_gov_api_gateway` | `snowflake_api_integration_amazon_api_gateway` |
| `aws_gov_private_api_gateway` | `snowflake_api_integration_amazon_api_gateway` |
| `azure_api_management` | `snowflake_api_integration_azure_api_management` |
| `google_api_gateway` | `snowflake_api_integration_google_cloud_api_gateway` |

Notable schema changes compared to the old resource:
- Computed attributes (`api_aws_iam_user_arn`, `api_aws_external_id`, `azure_consent_url`, `azure_multi_tenant_app_name`, `api_gcp_service_account`) have moved to `describe_output`
- `created_on` has moved to `show_output`
- `api_provider` in the Amazon API Gateway resource accepts only the four AWS variants; Azure and Google each have a dedicated resource with no `api_provider` field
- Each resource schema contains only the fields relevant to its integration type — provider-specific fields from other backends are no longer present

To achieve zero-downtime migration, please follow our [Resource migration guide](./docs/guides/resource_migration.md).

#### *(new feature)* `snowflake_api_integrations` data source

We have added a new preview data source for querying API integrations: [snowflake_api_integrations](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/data-sources/api_integrations).

The data source supports filtering with `like` and returns both `show_output` and `describe_output` for each integration. The unified `describe_output` covers all API integration provider types (AWS, Azure, Google, Git HTTPS, and External MCP) in a single schema — fields not applicable to a given provider are empty.

This feature will be marked as stable in future releases. To use it, add `snowflake_api_integrations_datasource` to the `preview_features_enabled` field in the provider configuration.

No changes are required for existing configurations unless you want to adopt any of these preview features with Terraform.

### *(new feature)* New storage lifecycle policy resources and data source

#### Resources

We have added new preview resources for storage lifecycle policies: [snowflake_storage_lifecycle_policy](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/storage_lifecycle_policy) for defining policies, and [snowflake_table_storage_lifecycle_policy_attachment](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/table_storage_lifecycle_policy_attachment) for attaching a storage lifecycle policy to a table or a dynamic table.

These features will be marked as stable in future releases. To use them, add the corresponding value to the `preview_features_enabled` field in the provider configuration:

- `snowflake_storage_lifecycle_policy_resource` for `snowflake_storage_lifecycle_policy`;
- `snowflake_table_storage_lifecycle_policy_attachment_resource` for `snowflake_table_storage_lifecycle_policy_attachment`.

#### Data source

We have added a new preview data source for storage lifecycle policies: [snowflake_storage_lifecycle_policies](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/data-sources/storage_lifecycle_policies).

This feature will be marked as stable in future releases. To use it, add `snowflake_storage_lifecycle_policies_datasource` to the `preview_features_enabled` field in the provider configuration.

No changes are required for existing configurations unless you want to adopt any of these preview features with Terraform.

### *(new feature)* New Iceberg Table resources

We have added new preview resources for Iceberg tables:
- [snowflake_iceberg_table_from_files](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/iceberg_table_from_files) for managing Snowflake Iceberg Tables created from files ([Snowflake docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-iceberg-table-iceberg-files)),
- [snowflake_iceberg_table_from_delta_files](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/iceberg_table_from_delta_files) for managing Snowflake Iceberg Tables created from Delta files ([Snowflake docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-iceberg-table-delta)).

These features will be marked as stable in future releases. To use them, add `snowflake_iceberg_table_from_files_resource` or `snowflake_iceberg_table_from_delta_files_resource` to the `preview_features_enabled` field in the provider configuration.

Stay tuned for the next variants of Iceberg Tables support in the provider!

### *(new feature)* Cortex Code daily credit limit account parameters

Added support for three new account parameters in the following resources:
- [`snowflake_account_parameter`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/account_parameter)
- [`snowflake_current_account`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/current_account)
- [`snowflake_current_organization_account`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/current_organization_account)
These parameters set the [Cortex Code per-user daily estimated credit usage limits](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cortex-code/credit-usage-limit) and are integer-valued (`-1` for the default/unlimited, `0` to block usage, or a positive cap on a user's estimated credit usage over a rolling 24-hour window):
- `CORTEX_CODE_CLI_DAILY_EST_CREDIT_LIMIT_PER_USER`
- `CORTEX_CODE_DESKTOP_DAILY_EST_CREDIT_LIMIT_PER_USER`
- `CORTEX_CODE_SNOWSIGHT_DAILY_EST_CREDIT_LIMIT_PER_USER`

No action is required; this is a non-breaking addition.

### *(new feature)* New `ENABLE_PER_ACCOUNT_APP_SERVICE_PRIVATELINK_URL` account parameter

The `ENABLE_PER_ACCOUNT_APP_SERVICE_PRIVATELINK_URL` parameter is now supported in the following resources:

- [`snowflake_account_parameter`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/account_parameter)
- [`snowflake_current_account`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/current_account)
- [`snowflake_current_organization_account`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/current_organization_account)

No changes are required for existing configurations.

References: [#4826](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/4826)

### *(new feature)* `log_event_level` parameter support

We added support for the [`LOG_EVENT_LEVEL`](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/parameters#log_event_level) parameter, following the same handling as the existing `log_level` parameter. The new `log_event_level` field is now available in the following resources:

- [`snowflake_current_account`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/current_account) and [`snowflake_current_organization_account`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/current_organization_account)
- [`snowflake_database`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/database), [`snowflake_secondary_database`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/secondary_database), and [`snowflake_shared_database`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/shared_database)
- [`snowflake_schema`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/schema)
- `snowflake_function_*` (Java, JavaScript, Python, Scala, SQL)
- `snowflake_procedure_*` (Java, JavaScript, Python, Scala, SQL)
- [`snowflake_task`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/task)
- [`snowflake_user`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/user), [`snowflake_service_user`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/service_user), and [`snowflake_legacy_service_user`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/legacy_service_user)

The `parameters` output of the related data sources (`snowflake_databases`, `snowflake_schemas`, `snowflake_functions`, `snowflake_procedures`, `snowflake_tasks`, and `snowflake_users`) now also exposes `log_event_level`. Additionally, the [`snowflake_account_parameter`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/account_parameter) resource now accepts `LOG_EVENT_LEVEL` as a parameter name.

No changes are required for existing configurations.

### *(new feature)* New instance families in the compute_pool resource

Added missing instance families that are available in Snowflake: `GEN_ARM_G1_2`, `GEN_ARM_G1_4`, `GEN_ARM_G1_8`, `GEN_ARM_G1_16`, `GEN_ARM_G1_32`, `GEN_X64_G2_2`, `GEN_X64_G2_4`, `GEN_X64_G2_8`, `GEN_X64_G2_16`, `GEN_X64_G2_32`, `MEM_X64_G2_8`, `MEM_X64_G2_32`, `MEM_X64_G2_64`, `MEM_X64_G2_96`, `MEM_X64_G2_192`, `GPU_L40S_G1_8`, `GPU_L40S_G1_16`, `GPU_L40S_G1_48`, `GPU_L40S_G1_192`, `GPU_R6K_G1_8`, `GPU_R6K_G1_16`, `GPU_R6K_G1_32`, `GPU_R6K_G1_48`, `GPU_R6K_G1_96`, `GPU_R6K_G1_192`, `GPU_A100_G1_12`, and `GPU_A100_G1_48`.

References: [#4916](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/4916)

### *(new feature)* `snowflake_grant_ownership`: support for new object types

The `snowflake_grant_ownership` resource now supports granting ownership on the following additional object types:

- `AGENT` — single object grants, bulk grants (`ALL AGENTS IN ...`), and future grants (`FUTURE AGENTS IN ...`)
- `CORTEX SEARCH SERVICE` — single object grants, bulk grants (`ALL CORTEX SEARCH SERVICES IN ...`), and future grants (`FUTURE CORTEX SEARCH SERVICES IN ...`)

No changes are required for existing configurations.

References: [#4868](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/4868)

### *(new feature)* Tagging support for iceberg table columns

Tagging support for iceberg table columns is now supported. We added a new `ICEBERG TABLE COLUMN` value to the allowed `object_type` values of the `snowflake_tag_association` resource. Use it to tag a column of an Iceberg table:

```terraform
resource "snowflake_tag_association" "example" {
  # For now, column fully qualified names have to be constructed manually.
  object_identifiers = [format("%s.\"column1\"", snowflake_iceberg_table.example.fully_qualified_name)]
  object_type        = "ICEBERG TABLE COLUMN"
  tag_id             = snowflake_tag.example.fully_qualified_name
  tag_value          = "example"
}
```

Do not use the `COLUMN` object type, as it is reserved for table columns.

### *(bugfix)* Fixed panic when adding a column with a constant default to a `snowflake_table`

Adding a new column with a constant (or expression) default to an existing `snowflake_table` (e.g. `default { constant = "false" }`) caused a nil-pointer panic, because the ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN path assumed the default was always an identity. This has been fixed: constant and expression defaults are now handled correctly when adding columns.

No changes in the configuration are required.

References: [#4730](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/4730)

### *(bugfix)* Fixed MODEL MONITOR object type in grant resources (non-empty plan)

Grants on future `MODEL MONITORS` in privilege grant resources (e.g. `snowflake_grant_privileges_to_account_role`, `snowflake_grant_privileges_to_database_role`)
produced perpetual non-empty plans because the provider did not match the object type Snowflake returns in SHOW GRANTS / SHOW FUTURE GRANTS
(for model monitors, Snowflake returns `QUALITY_MONITOR` instead of `MODEL MONITOR`).

This is the same class of object type name mismatch bug previously fixed for `AGENT` / `CORTEX_AGENT` and `MCP SERVER` / `CORTEX_AGENT_SERVER` in v2.15.0.

This has been fixed: grant resources can now be used with the `MODEL MONITOR` object type without any unexpected plans.

No changes in the configuration are required.

### *(bug fix)* SDK, literals, and privileges are now properly escaped

Multiple legacy SQL builders and provider resources previously interpolated user-provided values directly into SQL strings without proper quoting or escaping. This could lead to incorrect queries and Snowflake errors like SQL compilation error. The following areas have been fixed:
- Identifier SQL emission (provider-wide): double-quote characters inside quoted identifiers are now escaped as `""` in the SQL builder, matching the SQL standard.
- Single quotes are now correctly escaped in the following resources:
    - `snowflake_system_generate_scim_access_token`,
    - `snowflake_system_get_aws_sns_iam_policy`,
    - `snowflake_user_public_keys`,
    - `snowflake_table_column_masking_policy_application`,
    - Legacy `snowflake_stage` resource: the stage name, URL, comment, and storage integration fields. We kindly remind you that this resource is deprecated. Please use other [new stage resources](./MIGRATION_GUIDE.md#new-feature-new-stage-resources).
- Dollar-quoted fields: the `$$` sequence is now rejected in any field rendered with Snowflake dollar-quoting because `$$` cannot be escaped inside a dollar-quoted constant. The affected resources:
    - `snowflake_cortex_agent`,
    - `snowflake_listings`,
    - `snowflake_service`,
    - `snowflake_task`,
- The following fields are now wrapped by single quotes:
    - Stage location in `snowflake_listing` and `snowflake_service`: stage location values are now quoted with single quotes in the SDK-generated SQL.
    - Account and account_region in `snowflake_account` resource.
- Improved validations for object types and privileges: values with unexpected characters (e.g. semicolons, quotes) are rejected at plan time.

No action required.

### *(bug fix)* Explicit false in the provider block now correctly overrides TOML profile values

When a Boolean provider field was explicitly set to false in the provider block or environmental variables, the TOML value incorrectly took precedence. Affected fields: passcode_in_password, keep_session_alive, disable_query_context_cache, enable_single_use_refresh_tokens, log_query_text, log_query_parameters, crl_in_memory_cache_disabled, crl_on_disk_cache_disabled, disable_ocsp_checks / insecure_mode.

This behavior is now fixed: the values set explicitly in the provider block or in environmental variables take precedence.

No action required.

### *(improvement)* GRANT_ACCOUNT_ROLE_SHOW_CACHING experiment for snowflake_grant_account_role

A new experiment `GRANT_ACCOUNT_ROLE_SHOW_CACHING` is now available for the `snowflake_grant_account_role` resource. When enabled, the provider caches `SHOW GRANTS OF ROLE` results in memory for the duration of a single plan or apply cycle.

Without caching, every `snowflake_grant_account_role` instance issues an independent `SHOW GRANTS OF ROLE <name>` call during Read. In configurations with many grants sharing the same set of roles (a common RBAC topology), this produces N identical round-trips that each return the same full result set — only 1 is needed per unique role per plan.

When enabled, the first Read for a given role fetches and caches the result; subsequent Reads in the same plan reuse it. The cache is invalidated on Create and Delete so mutations within a single apply remain correctly visible to subsequent Reads. The trailing Read at the end of Create is also skipped (this resource has no computed or server-default fields to populate), removing a redundant `SHOW GRANTS OF ROLE` call per grant during apply.

To enable, add `GRANT_ACCOUNT_ROLE_SHOW_CACHING` to the `experimental_features_enabled` field in the provider configuration:

```hcl
provider "snowflake" {
  experimental_features_enabled = ["GRANT_ACCOUNT_ROLE_SHOW_CACHING"]
}
```

No changes to existing configurations are required. The experiment is intended for large RBAC configurations (thousands of `snowflake_grant_account_role` resources) where plan and apply time is dominated by redundant `SHOW GRANTS OF ROLE` calls.

### *(improvement)* snowflake_grant_ownership: deleting a resource with on_future now properly revokes the grant

If you use the future option in the snowflake_grant_ownership, it now issues REVOKE OWNERSHIP ON FUTURE ... TO ROLE ... during destroy.

No changes required for existing configurations

## v2.16.0 ➞ v2.17.0

### *(bug fix)* `snowflake_catalog_integration_iceberg_rest` and `snowflake_catalog_integration_open_catalog`: import fix for ForceNew fields

Previously, importing these resources with `terraform import` did not populate `ForceNew` fields in state. On the next `terraform plan`, Terraform detected a diff against the configuration and produced a destroy-before-create plan, even when the Snowflake object already matched the configuration.

Affected resources and fields:
- [`snowflake_catalog_integration_iceberg_rest`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/catalog_integration_iceberg_rest): `rest_config`, `oauth_rest_authentication`, `bearer_rest_authentication`, `sigv4_rest_authentication`
- [`snowflake_catalog_integration_open_catalog`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/catalog_integration_open_catalog): `rest_config`, `rest_authentication`

Import now reads the integration details from Snowflake and sets these fields in state during import. This prevents unwanted recreation plans for correctly configured integrations, except for the SigV4 limitation described below.

**Expected plan after import:** Snowflake does not return write-only secret values in `DESCRIBE CATALOG INTEGRATION` output. After import, the first `terraform plan` may therefore show an in-place **update** (not recreation) for sensitive fields that must be supplied in your configuration:

- `oauth_rest_authentication.0.oauth_client_secret` — `iceberg_rest` with OAuth authentication
- `bearer_rest_authentication.0.bearer_token` — `iceberg_rest` with bearer token authentication
- `rest_authentication.0.oauth_client_secret` — `open_catalog`

This is expected. Run `terraform apply` once to sync the secret values into state. Subsequent plans should be empty, assuming the configuration matches Snowflake.

**Known limitation for SigV4 authentication (`iceberg_rest` only):** `sigv4_rest_authentication.0.sigv4_external_id` is not returned by Snowflake, cannot be altered after creation,
and is marked as `ForceNew` in the provider. If your configuration specifies this field after import,
Terraform may still produce a destroy-before-create plan because the value cannot be populated in state during import and cannot be synced via an in-place update.
To avoid recreation after import for `sigv4_rest_authentication` you can:
- Omit `sigv4_external_id` if you don't need to track its changes within the configuration.
- Adjust the state value for `sigv4_external_id` manually or by following https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/state/recover.
- Accept the one-time recreation plan to align state with your configuration.

We plan to address this limitation in future, but for now, this behavior is expected.

### *(enhancement)* `snowflake_secret_with_client_credentials` — `oauth_scopes` is now optional

`oauth_scopes` was previously marked as required in the `snowflake_secret_with_client_credentials` resource, but Snowflake treats it as optional.
When omitted, the scopes are inherited internally from the attached security integration during the OAuth client credentials flow.

No changes are needed for existing configurations that already specify `oauth_scopes`.
If you want to omit `oauth_scopes` and rely on the integration's scopes, simply remove the field from your configuration.

References: [#3272](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/3272)

### *(new feature)* snowflake_catalog_integration_aws_glue: new `describe_output` attributes

The `snowflake_catalog_integration_aws_glue` resource now exposes two additional attributes under `describe_output`:
- `glue_aws_iam_user_arn`
- `glue_aws_external_id`

No changes are required for existing configurations.

References: [#4745](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/4745)

### *(new feature)* New Cortex agent resource and data source

#### Resource

We have added a new preview resource for managing Cortex agents: [snowflake_cortex_agent](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/cortex_agent).

This feature will be marked as stable in future releases. To use it, add `snowflake_cortex_agent_resource` to the `preview_features_enabled` field in the provider configuration.

#### Data source

We have added a new preview data source for Cortex agents: [snowflake_cortex_agents](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/data-sources/cortex_agents).

This feature will be marked as stable in future releases. To use it, add `snowflake_cortex_agents_datasource` to the `preview_features_enabled` field in the provider configuration.

No changes are required for existing configurations unless you want to adopt any of these preview features with Terraform.

### *(bug fix)* "Provider produced inconsistent final plan" when adding a reference to a not-yet-created resource

Previously, updating an existing resource to reference an attribute of another Terraform-managed resource that was being created in the same apply (for example, setting `resource_monitor = snowflake_resource_monitor.foo.fully_qualified_name` on an existing `snowflake_warehouse`) could fail with:

> Provider produced inconsistent final plan [...] produced an invalid new value for .show_output: was known, but now unknown.

The internal `ComputedIfAnyAttributeChanged` helper invoked each trigger field's `DiffSuppressFunc` against an empty string that was silently substituted for values still unknown at plan time, which caused computed outputs (like `show_output`) to be left marked as known. Once the referenced resource was created and the real value arrived at apply time, those outputs flipped to unknown — violating Terraform's plan/apply contract.

The helper now short-circuits whenever the new value of a trigger field is unknown and marks the dependent computed field as computed, without consulting the suppressor. The fix applies to every resource that uses this helper (including `snowflake_warehouse`, `snowflake_account`, `snowflake_account_role`, and many others), so references across resources now plan and apply correctly.

No configuration changes are required.

References: [#4188](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/4188)

### *(bugfix)* `snowflake_external_volume` — support for `use_privatelink_endpoint` in Azure deployments

Previously, setting `use_privatelink_endpoint = "true"` on an Azure storage location in `snowflake_external_volume` was silently ignored — the field was not sent to Snowflake and was not read back into state. The field is now correctly sent on create and update, and reflected in state after a read.

No configuration changes are required. After upgrading the provider, a `terraform apply` will update the state of existing Azure storage locations to reflect the value Snowflake returns for `USE_PRIVATELINK_ENDPOINT`.

Additionally, now when `use_privatelink_endpoint` is set to false explicitly, and the privatelink endpoint is not actually enabled in a Snowflake object, the plan will be empty. Previously, the plan was computed incorrectly as:
```
        Terraform will perform the following actions:

          # snowflake_external_volume.complete will be updated in-place
          ~ resource "snowflake_external_volume" "complete" {
                id                   = "MILRGWAT_3B02DC25_AF70_A697_0D4F_6DFE71E1DF67"
                name                 = "MILRGWAT_3B02DC25_AF70_A697_0D4F_6DFE71E1DF67"
                # (5 unchanged attributes hidden)

              ~ storage_location {
                  + use_privatelink_endpoint     = "false"
                    # (12 unchanged attributes hidden)
                }

                # (1 unchanged block hidden)
            }
```

Ref: [#4663](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/4663)

### *(enhancement)* Improved identifier handling in `snowflake_stream_on_directory_table`

Thanks to the changes introduced in [BCR-2170](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/bcr-bundles/2026_01/bcr-2170) (part of [Bundle 2026_01](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/bcr-bundles/2026_01_bundle)),
Snowflake now returns a fully qualified name for the stage behind a directory table stream in `SHOW STREAMS` output (previously, only a partially qualified name was returned).
This allowed us to resolve the long-standing limitation in `snowflake_stream_on_directory_table` tracked as [SNOW-1733130](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/2328):

- The `stage` attribute now expects, stores, and reads a fully qualified identifier (e.g. `"MY_DB"."MY_SCHEMA"."MY_STAGE"`), consistent with other identifier attributes in the provider.
- The previous requirement that the stage must live in the same schema as the stream has been lifted - stages from a different schema than the stream are now fully supported.

The state is automatically rewrites any existing `stage` value into its fully qualified form,
so no manual changes to the configuration or state are required when upgrading.

### *(bug fix)* `snowflake_schema`: setting `default_ddl_collation = ""` now overrides a value inherited from the parent database

Previously, setting `default_ddl_collation = ""` on a `snowflake_schema` was silently skipped when the parent database had a non-empty `DEFAULT_DDL_COLLATION` (e.g. `"pl"`). The update was a no-op and the schema kept inheriting the parent value.

The fix forces the plan to recognize the override whenever the parameter is inherited from a higher level (account/database), so the resulting `ALTER SCHEMA ... SET DEFAULT_DDL_COLLATION = ''` is executed and the parameter is pinned at the schema level with an empty value.

Example:

```terraform
resource "snowflake_database" "parent" {
  name                  = "PARENT_DB"
  default_ddl_collation = "en_US"
}

resource "snowflake_schema" "s" {
  database              = snowflake_database.parent.name
  name                  = "S"
  default_ddl_collation = "" # previously ignored; now correctly sets "" at schema level
}
```

No changes in configuration are required.

### *(new feature)* snowflake_system_get_privatelink_config: new attributes

The `snowflake_system_get_privatelink_config` data source now exposes additional attributes returned by `SYSTEM$GET_PRIVATELINK_CONFIG()`:

- `privatelink_account_principal` - The AWS principal ARN for outbound private connections.
- `app_service_privatelink_url` - Wildcard URL for routing Streamlit and Snowpark Container Services through private connectivity.
- `privatelink_snowflake_managed_storage_volume_fs` - Endpoint for failsafe Snowflake-managed storage volumes on Azure.
- `privatelink_snowflake_managed_storage_volume_nfs` - Endpoint for non-failsafe Snowflake-managed storage volumes on Azure.
- `privatelink_dashed_urls_for_duo` - Dashed URLs for Duo integration.
- `privatelink_gcp_service_attachment` - Endpoint for Google Cloud Private Service Connect.
- `privatelink_connection_ocsp_urls` - OCSP URLs for client redirect connections.
- `privatelink_connection_urls` - Connection URLs for client redirect.
- `regionless_privatelink_ocsp_url` - Regionless OCSP URL for private connectivity.

No changes are required for existing configurations that only reference the previously available attributes.

### *(bug fix)* snowflake_grant_privileges_to_account_role: CONNECTION object type support

Previously, attempting to grant privileges on a `CONNECTION` object type in the `on_account_object` block would fail with the following error, despite `CONNECTION` being listed as an allowed value in the schema:

```
Error: [grants_validations.go:315] exactly one of GrantOnAccountObject
fields [User ResourceMonitor Warehouse ComputePool Database Integration
FailoverGroup ReplicationGroup ExternalVolume] must be set
```

This has been fixed — the resource now correctly handles `CONNECTION` as an account object type.

No changes are required for existing configurations.

References: [#4727](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/4727)

### *(improvement)* New `on_conflict` field in `show_output` for `snowflake_tag` and `snowflake_tags`

A new `on_conflict` field has been added to the `show_output` attribute on both the [`snowflake_tag`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/tag) resource and the [`snowflake_tags`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/data-sources/tags) data source. It reflects the propagation on-conflict strategy returned by `SHOW TAGS`.

The field is only populated when the [BCR-2291](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/bcr-bundles/2026_03/bcr-2291) change (bundle `2026_03`) is enabled on your account. When the bundle is disabled, `on_conflict` is absent from the `SHOW TAGS` output and the provider leaves the existing state value unchanged to avoid spurious diffs.

No configuration changes are required.

### *(bug fix)* `snowflake_saml2_integration`: removing `enabled` from config now restores Snowflake's default of `TRUE`

Previously, removing the `enabled` attribute from a `snowflake_saml2_integration` configuration (returning it to its default unmanaged state) caused the provider to issue `ALTER ... SET ENABLED = FALSE`. This contradicted Snowflake's behavior, where the default for `ENABLED` on a SAML2 integration is `TRUE` after [BCR-2166](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/bcr-bundles/2026_01/bcr-2166) in bundle `2026_01`.

The provider now issues `ALTER ... SET ENABLED = TRUE` when `enabled` is removed from config, aligning the unmanaged state with Snowflake's actual default. The `UNSET` operation for this object is still not supported in Snowflake.

If you previously relied on the prior behavior (the integration being silently disabled when `enabled` was unset), set `enabled = "false"` explicitly in your configuration before upgrading. Otherwise, no changes are required.

## v2.15.x ➞ v2.16.0

### *(improvement)* snowflake_password_policy resource rework

The [snowflake_password_policy](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/password_policy) resource has been reworked to follow the modern resource patterns used in this provider.

#### New computed attributes

The resource now exposes `show_output` and `describe_output` computed attributes that provide the raw results from Snowflake's `SHOW PASSWORD POLICIES` and `DESCRIBE PASSWORD POLICY` commands, respectively. This allows users to access all server-side values without needing additional data sources.

#### Integer fields no longer have hardcoded defaults

Previously, all integer fields (`min_length`, `max_length`, etc.) had hardcoded `Default` values in the schema. These have been removed in favor of Snowflake-managed defaults. When a field is not specified in the Terraform configuration, the resource will not send that parameter to Snowflake, allowing it to use its own default value.

Fields where 0 is a valid value (`min_upper_case_chars`, `min_lower_case_chars`, `min_numeric_chars`, `min_special_chars`, `min_age_days`, `max_age_days`, `history`) now use `-1` as the default sentinel. Setting one of these fields to `-1` explicitly (or omitting it from config) means "use the Snowflake default".

Fields where 0 is not a valid value (`min_length`, `max_length`, `max_retries`, `lockout_time_mins`) are now plain optional fields with no default. Omitting them means "use the Snowflake default".

After importing the state, the plan may be not empty for the fields missing from the configuration due to this change. You can either apply the plan, or set the specific values in the configuration.

#### Removed client-side validation

Client-side `ValidateFunc` constraints (e.g., `IntBetween(8, 256)` for `min_length`) have been removed from all integer fields. Validation is now delegated to Snowflake, which will return an error if a value is out of range. This avoids drift between the provider's hardcoded ranges and Snowflake's actual limits.

#### `or_replace` and `if_not_exists` fields deprecated

The `or_replace` and `if_not_exists` fields are now deprecated as noops. They will be removed in a future version.

#### ID format change

During [identifiers rework](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/ROADMAP.md#identifiers-rework) the internal resource ID format has changed from pipe-separated (`database|schema|name`) to fully qualified name format (`"database"."schema"."name"`). This is handled automatically by a state upgrader — no manual action is required. Read more in the [design decisions](./docs/guides/identifiers_rework_design_decisions.md).

#### Identifier fields now support quoting

The `database`, `schema`, and `name` fields now support quoted identifiers and suppress diffs caused by identifier quoting differences (read more in the [design decisions](./docs/guides/identifiers_rework_design_decisions.md)). Additionally, certain characters are blocklisted from these fields — see the resource documentation for details.

#### Import behavior

The import now uses `ImportName` for `SchemaObjectIdentifier`, which properly sets `database`, `schema`, and `name` fields. The import ID should be the fully qualified name of the password policy (e.g., `"my_database"."my_schema"."my_policy"`).

### *(new feature)* snowflake_password_policies data source

We have added a new preview data source for password policies: [snowflake_password_policies](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/data-sources/password_policies). It supports filtering with `like`, `in`, and `limit`, and optionally runs `DESCRIBE PASSWORD POLICY` for each result (controlled by the `with_describe` attribute, enabled by default).

This feature will be marked as stable in future releases. To use it, add `snowflake_password_policies_datasource` to the `preview_features_enabled` field in the provider configuration.

### *(improvement)* Catalog integration resources: computed `catalog_source`

A new **computed** attribute **`catalog_source`** is now available on these resources:

- [snowflake_catalog_integration_aws_glue](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/catalog_integration_aws_glue)
- [snowflake_catalog_integration_object_storage](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/catalog_integration_object_storage)
- [snowflake_catalog_integration_open_catalog](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/catalog_integration_open_catalog)
- [snowflake_catalog_integration_iceberg_rest](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/catalog_integration_iceberg_rest)

It reflects the active catalog source type Snowflake reports for the integration (for example `GLUE`, `OBJECT_STORE`, `POLARIS`, or `ICEBERG_REST`). The attribute is used to detect when the catalog source was changed outside of Terraform and to recreate the resource when that happens.

No configuration changes are required.

### *(new feature)* New session policy resources and data source

#### Resources

We have added new preview resources for session policies: [snowflake_session_policy](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/session_policy) for defining policies, [snowflake_user_session_policy_attachment](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/user_session_policy_attachment) for assigning a session policy to a user, and [snowflake_account_session_policy_attachment](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/account_session_policy_attachment) for assigning a session policy to the current account.

These features will be marked as stable in future releases. To use them, add the corresponding value to the `preview_features_enabled` field in the provider configuration:

- `snowflake_session_policy_resource` for `snowflake_session_policy`;
- `snowflake_user_session_policy_attachment_resource` for `snowflake_user_session_policy_attachment`;
- `snowflake_account_session_policy_attachment_resource` for `snowflake_account_session_policy_attachment`.

#### Data source

We have added a new preview data source for session policies: [snowflake_session_policies](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/data-sources/session_policies).

This feature will be marked as stable in future releases. To use it, add `snowflake_session_policies_datasource` to the `preview_features_enabled` field in the provider configuration.

No changes are required for existing configurations unless you want to adopt any of these preview features with Terraform.

### *(bug fix)* `snowflake_stream_on_table` and `snowflake_stream_on_view` import fix

Previously, importing `snowflake_stream_on_table` or `snowflake_stream_on_view` with `terraform import` left the `show_initial_rows` attribute as `null` in state, because it cannot be read from Snowflake. On the next `terraform apply`, Terraform detected a diff and produced an "Update" plan. Because of it, the stream was recreated (see the [note](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/stream_on_table)).

To fix this, enable the `IMPORT_BOOLEAN_DEFAULT` experimental feature in the provider configuration and reimport the affected stream resources. When enabled, the `show_initial_rows` attribute is set to `"default"` during import, preventing the permadiff.

References: [#3896](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/3896)

### *(bugfix)* TABLE data type parsing with parametrized column types

In v2.15.0, resources that accept a `TABLE(...)` data type (e.g. return type in `snowflake_function_sql` or `snowflake_procedure_sql`)
failed with an error when column types inside the `TABLE` definition carried precision or scale parameters (e.g. `NUMBER(38,0)`, `VARCHAR(256)`).
The comma inside the type parameter was incorrectly treated as a column separator, producing a parse error similar to:

```
number NUMBER(38 could not be parsed, use "NUMBER(precision, scale)" format
```

This release fixes the parser to correctly handle nested parentheses when splitting column definitions,
so `TABLE(ARG1 NUMBER(38,0), ARG2 VARCHAR)` is now parsed correctly.

No configuration changes are required.

### *(bug fix)* Improve handling of granting PUBLIC role

A new experiment `GRANT_ACCOUNT_ROLE_SAFE_PUBLIC_ROLE` is now available for the `snowflake_grant_account_role` resource. When enabled, granting the PUBLIC role is treated as a silent no-op instead of producing an inconsistent-result error.

Snowflake implicitly grants PUBLIC to every role and user, so `GRANT ROLE PUBLIC` is always a no-op at the SQL level and `SHOW GRANTS` never lists it. Without this experiment, the provider's Read clears the state because it cannot find the grant, resulting in `Root object was present, but now absent` errors.

To enable, add `GRANT_ACCOUNT_ROLE_SAFE_PUBLIC_ROLE` to the `experimental_features_enabled` field in the provider configuration. No changes are required for existing configurations that do not grant the PUBLIC role.

References: [#3001](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/3001)

### *(bugfix)* Fixed `snowflake_tag` crash on Standard accounts

In v2.15.0 we added the `propagate` field to the `snowflake_tag` resource. On [Standard accounts](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/intro-editions#standard-edition), Snowflake always returns the `propagate` column in `SHOW TAGS` with `null` value. The provider attempted to scan a SQL `NULL` into a non-nullable Go string, resulting in a fatal error whenever any `snowflake_tag` resource was refreshed on such accounts:

```text
│ Error: sql: Scan error on column index 8, name "propagate": converting NULL to string is unsupported
```

The `propagate` field is now treated as nullable.

No changes in configuration are required. Users on standard accounts who experienced a crash on plan or apply should be able to use the `snowflake_tag` resource normally after upgrading.

## v2.14.x ➞ v2.15.0

### **IMPORTANT** *(improvement)* Go driver bumped to v2

There was a recent major release for the underlying Go Snowflake driver ([summary](https://github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake/issues/1586) and [v2.0.0 release notes](https://github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake/releases/tag/v2.0.0)). It introduced a few breaking changes but the provider adopted them in a non-breaking way - summary in the sections below. Keep in mind, that we will align the behavior with the driver in the next major release of the provider.

#### `ClientIP` configuration attribute removed from the driver

`ClientIP` attribute was not used by the driver internally. It's still allowed to set this attribute on the provider configuration side, but:
- it won't be passed to the driver;
- it will be removed with the next major release.

No changes are required, but because `client_ip` attribute is not affecting the configuration, you can safely remove it, to reduce the number of required changes in the next major provider release.

#### `InsecureMode` configuration attribute removed from the driver

`InsecureMode` attribute was deprecated both in the driver and the provider for a long time already. It's behavior was the same as using `DisableOCSPChecks`. We still allow to set it, but:
- setting any of `insecure_mode` or `disable_ocsp_checks` to `true` sets the `DisableOCSPChecks` on the driver side (from every perspective: tf config, environment variable, TOML config).
- `insecure_mode` will be removed with the next major release.

No changes are required, but because `insecure_mode` will be removed in the next major version, switch to `disable_ocsp_checks`, to reduce the number of required changes in the next major provider release.

#### `TelemetryDisabled` configuration attribute removed from the driver

`TelemetryDisabled` was removed from the driver. To avoid making it a breaking change in the provider, setting it in your configuration will cause `CLIENT_TELEMETRY_ENABLED` with value `false` to be added to session parameters (`params` map). It shouldn't affect the existing configurations as:
- in the previous Go driver versions, setting `CLIENT_TELEMETRY_ENABLED` parameter had no effect (only `TelemetryDisabled` mattered);
- the parameter is by default set to `true`.

No changes are required, but switch to `CLIENT_TELEMETRY_ENABLED` instead of the `telemetry_disabled` attribute, to reduce the number of required changes in the next major provider release.

#### `KeepSessionAlive` configuration attribute renamed on the driver side

`KeepSessionAlive` was renamed to `ServerSessionKeepAlive` to align it with other drivers.

No changes are required. `keep_session_alive` attribute will be renamed in the next major provider release.

#### `DriverTracing` log levels changes on the driver side

The driver changed the supported log levels. The `print` and `panic` levels no longer exist, and a new `off` level was added. The valid values are now: `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal`, `off`.

For backward compatibility, the following deprecated values are still accepted and mapped automatically:
- `warning` → `warn`
- `panic` → `fatal`
- `print` → `info`

No changes are required, but switch to the new values, as the deprecated ones will be removed in the next major provider release.

### **IMPORTANT** *(new feature)* GRANTS_SAFE_DESTROY experiment

A new `GRANTS_SAFE_DESTROY` experiment has been added. When enabled, resource destroy operations silently succeed when the underlying Snowflake object (or its dependencies) no longer exists, instead of failing with `does not exist or not authorized`.

This is useful when, for example, a warehouse or role is deleted externally and the corresponding grant resource is later removed from the Terraform configuration.

Currently supported by: `snowflake_grant_privileges_to_account_role`, `snowflake_grant_privileges_to_database_role`, `snowflake_grant_privileges_to_share`, `snowflake_grant_account_role`, `snowflake_grant_database_role`, `snowflake_grant_application_role`, `snowflake_grant_ownership`.

To enable, add `GRANTS_SAFE_DESTROY` to your provider's `experimental_features_enabled` list:
```hcl
provider "snowflake" {
  experimental_features_enabled = ["GRANTS_SAFE_DESTROY"]
}
```

### **IMPORTANT** *(new feature)* TAG_ASSOCIATION_SAFE_DESTROY experiment

A new `TAG_ASSOCIATION_SAFE_DESTROY` experiment has been added. When enabled, `snowflake_tag_association` destroy operations silently succeed when the tagged object (or its parent hierarchy) no longer exists, instead of failing with `does not exist or not authorized` or `object does not exist, or operation cannot be performed`.

This is useful when, for example, a table or schema is deleted externally and the corresponding tag association resource is later removed from the Terraform configuration. It also fixes [#3869](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/3869), where destroying a column-level tag association failed when the parent table or schema had already been dropped.

To enable, add `TAG_ASSOCIATION_SAFE_DESTROY` to your provider's `experimental_features_enabled` list:
```hcl
provider "snowflake" {
  experimental_features_enabled = ["TAG_ASSOCIATION_SAFE_DESTROY"]
}
```

### *(new feature)* snowflake_tag resource changes

#### Improved `allowed_values` handling in `snowflake_tag`

Previously, removing `allowed_values` from your tag configuration did not revert the tag to accepting any value, and there was no way to explicitly block all values.
The new `TAGS_ALLOW_EMPTY_ALLOWED_VALUES` experimental feature fixes both issues, giving you full control over which values a tag accepts:
omit `allowed_values` to allow any value, specify a list to restrict to certain values, or set `no_allowed_values = true` to block all values entirely.
The `allowed_values` and `no_allowed_values` fields are conflicting and cannot be set at the same time.

Here are examples presenting all options for allowed values management:

1. Any value is allowed (`allowed_values` should be removed from the configuration or left empty)

```terraform
resource "snowflake_tag" "example" {
  name     = "my_tag"
  database = "my_database"
  schema   = "my_schema"
  # or allowed_values = []
}
```

2. Given values are allowed (`allowed_values` should be set to the desired values)

```terraform
resource "snowflake_tag" "example" {
  name           = "my_tag"
  database       = "my_database"
  schema         = "my_schema"
  allowed_values = ["production", "staging", "development"]
}
```

3. No value is allowed (`no_allowed_values` field set to true)

```terraform
resource "snowflake_tag" "example" {
  name              = "my_tag"
  database          = "my_database"
  schema            = "my_schema"
  no_allowed_values = true
}
```

It's not enabled by default and to use it, you have to enable this feature on the provider level
by adding `TAGS_ALLOW_EMPTY_ALLOWED_VALUES` to the [`experimental_features_enabled`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs#experimental_features_enabled-1) provider field.

**It's still considered a preview feature, even when applied to the stable resources.**

No changes in configuration are required.
Without the flag enabled, the behavior remains the same as in previous versions.

#### Propagation and conflict resolution support

We added support for [tag propagation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/object-tagging/propagation) to the `snowflake_tag` resource. The following new fields are now available:

- `propagate` - Controls how the tag propagates. Valid values are `ON_DEPENDENCY`, `ON_DATA_MOVEMENT`, `ON_DEPENDENCY_AND_DATA_MOVEMENT`, and `NONE`. Omitting this attribute is equivalent to `NONE`.
- `on_conflict` - Configures how conflicting tag values from multiple source objects are resolved during propagation. Requires `propagate` to be set. Supports two mutually exclusive options:
  - `on_conflict.0.allowed_values_sequence` - Resolves conflicts using the order defined in the tag's `ordered_allowed_values`. Requires `ordered_allowed_values` to be set.
  - `on_conflict.0.custom_value` - Resolves conflicts by using a custom string value.

#### New `ordered_allowed_values` field

A new `ordered_allowed_values` field (TypeList) has been added to the `snowflake_tag` resource.
It is preferred over the existing `allowed_values` field (TypeSet) because it preserves the order you specify — which is required when using `on_conflict.allowed_values_sequence` for tag propagation conflict resolution,
where the first matching value in the sequence wins. For more details, see [tag propagation conflicts](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/object-tagging/propagation#tag-propagation-conflicts) documentation.

The `allowed_values` field is now **deprecated** and will be removed in the next major version. The two fields are mutually exclusive (`ConflictsWith`), so you can migrate at your own pace.

**Migration:** Replace `allowed_values` with `ordered_allowed_values` in your configuration:

```hcl
# Before
resource "snowflake_tag" "example" {
  # ...
  allowed_values = ["production", "staging", "development"]
}

# After
resource "snowflake_tag" "example" {
  # ...
  ordered_allowed_values = ["production", "staging", "development"]
}
```

After switching, run `terraform plan` — Terraform will show an update moving the values from `allowed_values` to `ordered_allowed_values`.
The tag's allowed values in Snowflake remain unchanged (what only may be altered is the order of the values).

**Import behavior:** When importing a `snowflake_tag` resource, values are always populated into the `ordered_allowed_values` field.
If your configuration uses the deprecated `allowed_values` field, the first `terraform plan` after import will show an update moving the values to the correct field.

#### New `propagate` field in `show_output`

A new `propagate` field has been added to the `show_output` attribute on both the `snowflake_tag` resource and the `snowflake_tags` data source. It reflects the propagation method returned by `SHOW TAGS`.

No configuration changes are required. If you reference `show_output` in your configuration, the new field will be available automatically.

### *(new feature)* Adaptive warehouses support

#### New adaptive warehouse resource

We have added a new preview resource for managing adaptive warehouses [snowflake_warehouse_adaptive](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/warehouse_adaptive).

Adaptive Compute is a compute service focused on delivering strong performance with effortless operations. It replaces the fixed compute of the Standard Warehouse with a workload-aware one that adapts to your queries automatically. The system decides how to allocate resources for the best performance, eliminating the need for infrastructure tuning.

This feature will be marked as stable in a future release. To use it, add `snowflake_warehouse_adaptive_resource` to the `preview_features_enabled` field in the provider configuration.

#### Adaptive warehouse columns in `snowflake_warehouses` data source

The `show_output` field in the `snowflake_warehouses` data source now includes two additional computed attributes that surface adaptive warehouse details:

- `max_query_performance_level` — the initial compute capacity level of an adaptive warehouse
- `query_throughput_multiplier` — the query throughput multiplier of an adaptive warehouse

These fields are populated only when the warehouse type is `ADAPTIVE`; for standard and Snowpark-Optimized warehouses they remain empty. No configuration changes are required.

### *(new feature)* Support for future grants on `IMAGE REPOSITORIES`

Both, `snowflake_grant_privileges_to_account_role` and `snowflake_grant_privileges_to_database_role` resources,
now support the `IMAGE REPOSITORY` for future grants (in `on_schema_object.future.object_type_plural`).

No changes to existing configurations are required.

### *(new feature)* `encryption` attribute in `snowflake_image_repository` resource

A new optional `encryption` attribute has been added to the `snowflake_image_repository` resource.
It controls the encryption type used for the image repository and can only be set at creation time.
Valid values are (case-insensitive): `SNOWFLAKE_FULL`, `SNOWFLAKE_SSE`.
If omitted, Snowflake default is used.

Changing the `encryption` value requires destroying and recreating the resource.

No configuration changes are required if you do not need to manage the encryption type explicitly.
The actual Snowflake encryption type is always available via `show_output[0].encryption`.

**Import behavior:** Importing an existing image repository does not populate the `encryption` field in the resource configuration. To avoid a diff after import, either omit `encryption` from your configuration or set it explicitly to match the current Snowflake value.

State is upgraded automatically — no manual changes are required.

### *(new feature)* snowflake_account_parameter: adding missing parameters

The `snowflake_account_parameter` resource now supports the following additional parameters:
- `ALLOW_BIND_VALUES_ACCESS`
- `ALLOWED_SPCS_WORKLOAD_TYPES`
- `DATA_METRIC_SCHEDULE`
- `DEFAULT_DBT_VERSION`
- `DISALLOWED_SPCS_WORKLOAD_TYPES`
- `ENABLE_BUDGET_EVENT_LOGGING`
- `CORTEX_MODELS_ALLOWLIST`
- `ENABLE_CORTEX_ANALYST`
- `ENABLE_DATA_COMPACTION`
- `ENABLE_GET_DDL_USE_DATA_TYPE_ALIAS`
- `ENABLE_ICEBERG_MERGE_ON_READ`
- `ENABLE_NOTEBOOK_CREATION_IN_PERSONAL_DB`
- `ENABLE_SPCS_BLOCK_STORAGE_SNOWFLAKE_FULL_ENCRYPTION_ENFORCEMENT`
- `ENABLE_TAG_PROPAGATION_EVENT_LOGGING`
- `ICEBERG_VERSION_DEFAULT`
- `READ_CONSISTENCY_MODE`
- `ROW_TIMESTAMP_DEFAULT`
- `SQL_TRACE_QUERY_TEXT`
- `USE_WORKSPACES_FOR_SQL`

No changes are required for existing configurations.

### *(new feature)* New catalog integration resources and data source

#### Resources

We have added new preview resources for managing catalog integrations:
- [snowflake_catalog_integration_aws_glue](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/catalog_integration_aws_glue)
- [snowflake_catalog_integration_object_storage](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/catalog_integration_object_storage)
- [snowflake_catalog_integration_open_catalog](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/catalog_integration_open_catalog)
- [snowflake_catalog_integration_iceberg_rest](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/catalog_integration_iceberg_rest)

These features will be marked as stable in future releases. To use them, add
- `snowflake_catalog_integration_aws_glue_resource`,
- `snowflake_catalog_integration_object_storage_resource`,
- `snowflake_catalog_integration_open_catalog_resource`, or
- `snowflake_catalog_integration_iceberg_rest_resource`
to the `preview_features_enabled` field in the provider configuration.

#### Data source

We have added a new preview data source for catalog integrations: [snowflake_catalog_integrations](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/data-sources/catalog_integrations).

This feature will be marked as stable in future releases. To use it, add `snowflake_catalog_integrations_datasource` to the `preview_features_enabled` field in the provider configuration.

### *(new feature)* Private Facts and Metrics support in Semantic Views

We have added support for Private Facts and Metrics in the Semantic Views resource.

### *(new feature)* New `snowflake_external_volumes` data source

Added a new `snowflake_external_volumes` data source that allows querying existing external volumes. It supports `like` filtering and an optional `with_describe` flag (default `true`) to include `DESCRIBE EXTERNAL VOLUME` output. This data source is a preview feature and must be enabled by adding `snowflake_external_volumes_datasource` to `preview_features_enabled` in provider configuration.

### *(new feature)* snowflake_grant_ownership: support for DBT PROJECT object type

The `snowflake_grant_ownership` resource now supports granting ownership on `DBT PROJECT` objects. This includes single object grants, bulk grants (`ALL DBT PROJECTS IN ...`), and future grants (`FUTURE DBT PROJECTS IN ...`). For more details, see [Access control for dbt projects on Snowflake](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-engineering/dbt-projects-on-snowflake-access-control).

No changes in configuration are required.

### *(improvements)* snowflake_authentication_policy and snowflake_authentication_policies

#### Resource `snowflake_authentication_policy`
- New optional block **`client_policy`**.
- New field **`pat_policy.require_role_restriction_for_service_users`**.
- New **`OTP`** option added to `mfa_policy.allowed_methods`.
- New field **`client_policy`** added to **`describe_output`**.

#### Data source `snowflake_authentication_policies`
- New field **`client_policy`** added to **`describe_output`**.

For more details about added features head over to the [Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-authentication-policy) or [Terraform Registry documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/authentication_policy).

No changes are required to existing configurations unless you want to adopt any of the newly introduced features.

### *(improvement)* Rework of `snowflake_external_volume` resource

We have added support for S3-compatible (S3COMPAT) storage locations and several missing S3 fields to the `snowflake_external_volume` resource.

New fields in `storage_location`:
- `storage_aws_access_point_arn` - Access point ARN for S3/S3GOV storage locations.
- `use_privatelink_endpoint` - Whether to use a privatelink endpoint (S3, S3GOV, and AZURE).
- `storage_endpoint` - Endpoint for S3COMPAT storage locations.
- `storage_aws_key_id` - AWS key ID for S3COMPAT storage locations.
- `storage_aws_secret_key` - AWS secret key for S3COMPAT storage locations (sensitive).

#### *(breaking change)* `storage_aws_external_id` changed from computed to optional

Previously, `storage_aws_external_id` in `storage_location` was a computed (read-only) field populated by Snowflake. It is now an optional user-configurable field. A state upgrader clears the previously computed value automatically, so no changes to existing configurations are required and `terraform plan` will show no drift after upgrading.

If you previously referenced `storage_location.*.storage_aws_external_id` (e.g. in `output` blocks or `local` values), note that it will now be empty unless you explicitly set it. The Snowflake-generated external ID remains accessible via `describe_output.0.storage_locations.*.s3_storage_location.0.storage_aws_external_id`.

#### *(breaking change)* `snowflake_external_volume` resource `describe_output` schema changed

The `describe_output` attribute on the `snowflake_external_volume` resource has been restructured.
Previously it was a flat list of property rows with `parent`, `name`, `type`, `value`, and `default` fields.
It is now a single structured object with `active`, `comment`, `allow_writes`, and `storage_locations` fields,
where `storage_locations` contains typed, per-provider sub-objects (`s3_storage_location`, `gcs_storage_location`,
`azure_storage_location`, `s3_compat_storage_location`).

A state upgrader handles the migration automatically. No changes to your resource configuration are required,
but if you reference `describe_output` in other parts of your Terraform config (e.g. `output` blocks or `local` values),
you will need to update those references to match the new schema. For example:

Before:
```terraform
output "ev_comment" {
  value = [for p in snowflake_external_volume.test.describe_output : p.value if p.name == "COMMENT"][0]
}
```

After:
```terraform
output "ev_comment" {
  value = snowflake_external_volume.test.describe_output[0].comment
}
```

### *(bugfix)* snowflake_account: fix nil pointer dereference panics

Previously, the `snowflake_account` resource could panic with a nil pointer dereference in the following scenarios:
- During **import**, if some fields (`edition`, `is_org_admin`, `consumption_billing_entity`) were not returned by `SHOW ACCOUNTS`.
- During **read** (plan/apply), if the same fields were missing from the Snowflake response.

These panics are now replaced with proper nil checks and error messages.

References: [#4101](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/4101#issuecomment-4069319904).

### *(bugfix)* Fixed allowed_accounts update in snowflake_failover_group

Previously, updating the `allowed_accounts` field would fail because the constructed request was not correct. This has been fixed and `allowed_accounts` can now be updated correctly without requiring workarounds.

No changes in the configuration are required.

Reference: [#3946](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/3946)

### *(bugfix)* Fixed AGENT and MCP SERVER object types in grant resources (non-empty plan)

In v2.14.0 we added support for the `AGENT` and `MCP SERVER` object types in privilege grant resources (e.g. `snowflake_grant_privileges_to_account_role`, `snowflake_grant_privileges_to_database_role`),
but grants on these objects or future objects of these types produced perpetual non-empty plans because the provider did not match the object types Snowflake returns in SHOW GRANTS / SHOW FUTURE GRANTS
(for agents, Snowflake returns `CORTEX_AGENT` instead of `AGENT`; for MCP servers, Snowflake returns `CORTEX_AGENT_SERVER` instead of `MCP SERVER`).

This has been fixed: grant resources can now be used with the `AGENT` and `MCP SERVER` object types without any unexpected plans.

No changes in the configuration are required.

References: [#4524](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/4524), [#4593](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/4593).

### *(bugfix)* Fixed panic in `snowflake_view` when the last column has a masking policy without a `using` clause

The `snowflake_view` resource could panic with `index out of range` during plan, apply, or refresh when the last column definition included a `masking_policy` block without a `using` argument. The error could be as follows:
```
panic: runtime error: index out of range [276] with length 276

goroutine 149 [running]:
github.com/Snowflake-Labs/terraform-provider-snowflake/pkg/snowflake.(*ViewSelectStatementExtractor).consumeToken(0x1400077c818, {0x103fb7629, 0x11})
	github.com/Snowflake-Labs/terraform-provider-snowflake/pkg/snowflake/parser.go:242 +0x150
...
```

This was caused by a missing early-exit check in the internal SQL parser used to extract the view's `SELECT` statement after consuming the masking policy identifier.

No changes in configuration are required. If this error happened during object creation, the state of this resource may be empty. In this case, just reimport the object.

### *(bugfix)* Fixed `describe_output` permadiff on stage resources

The `describe_output` computed attribute on all stage resources (`snowflake_stage_external_s3`, `snowflake_stage_external_azure`, `snowflake_stage_external_gcs`, `snowflake_stage_external_s3_compatible`, `snowflake_stage_internal`) was incorrectly tracking `file_format` as a trigger for recomputation. The provider normalizes selected file format subfields (e.g. resolves identifier quoting), but it's not applied in the recomputation logic, which could lead to permadiffs.

Now, changes on `file_format` do not trigger marking `describe_output` as computed in all stage resources.

No changes in configuration are required.

Reference: [#4514](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/4514)

## v2.14.0 ➞ v2.14.1

### *(breaking change)* Adjustments in `snowflake_authentication_policy` and `snowflake_authentication_policies` due to `DESC AUTHENTICATION POLICY` output change

Due to recent Snowflake release (`10.10.2`) changing the `DESC AUTHENTICATION POLICY` output,
the authentication_policy resource started to fail trying to parse changed format.

The errors may look similar to the following:
```
╷
│ Error: object does not exist
│
│
│   with snowflake_authentication_policy.test,
│   on test.tf line 3, in resource "snowflake_authentication_policy" "test":
│    3: resource "snowflake_authentication_policy" "test" {
│
```

What changed on the Snowflake side:
- The row with `MFA_AUTHENTICATION_METHODS` is no longer returned (main root cause of the above error).
- For default `MFA_ENROLLMENT` value (`OPTIONAL`) Snowflake now returns `REQUIRED_SNOWFLAKE_UI_PASSWORD_ONLY`, instead of `REQUIRED_PASSWORD_ONLY`.

Because of this change, every provider version is potentially affected, and version bump to v2.14.1 is required to fix above error.

This change updates the `describe_output` parsing and **removes** the already deprecated `mfa_authentication_methods` field from the `describe_output` computed field.
This affects the `describe_output` in the `snowflake_authentication_policy` resource as well as `snowflake_authentication_policies` data source.

For compatibility, the top-level settable `mfa_authentication_methods` attribute will stay, but now, won't be populated by the provider's Read operation,
and still any configuration changes to it will have no effect. Although the field remains for now, it may be removed in a future release as both,
`snowflake_authentication_policy` resource and `snowflake_authentication_policies` data source, are still preview features.
Read more about preview and stable features in our [documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs#support).

After upgrading to the latest provider version,
please remove any `mfa_authentication_methods` references from your `snowflake_authentication_policy` resources just in case.
Other than that, no configuration changes are necessary.

References: [#4557](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/4557)

### *(bugfix)* Importing boolean fields in stage resources

When importing stage resources (`snowflake_stage_external_s3`, `snowflake_stage_external_azure`, `snowflake_stage_external_gcs`, `snowflake_stage_external_s3_compatible`, and `snowflake_stage_internal`), boolean fields like `auto_refresh`, `trim_space`, `skip_blank_lines`, etc. were set to the actual Snowflake value (e.g., `"false"`) instead of the schema default `"default"`. This caused an unavoidable diff on every `terraform plan` after import. Some of these fields are mutually exclusive with others, so they can't be set in the configuration to match the actual value in Snowflake.

To fix this, we introduce the new `IMPORT_BOOLEAN_DEFAULT` experiment. The fix is enabled by such flag because the import behavior differs from other resources.

When this experiment is enabled, boolean fields that use special default values are set to `"default"` during import, preventing the persistent plan diff.

To use this feature, add `IMPORT_BOOLEAN_DEFAULT` to the `experimental_features_enabled` field in the provider configuration.

Without the flag enabled, the behavior remains the same as in previous versions.

References: [#4549](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/4549).
## v2.13.x ➞ v2.14.0

### *(new feature)* Private Facts and Metrics support in Semantic Views

We have added support for Private Facts and Metrics in the Semantic Views resource.

### *(new feature)* Added `DECFLOAT` support

We added the [`DECFLOAT`](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/data-types-numeric#decfloat) data type support inside the provider.
It applies to all resources and data sources, however, keep in mind that these are limited by the underlying Snowflake objects capabilities (check the [limitations section](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/data-types-numeric#limitations-for-the-decfloat-data-type) in Snowflake public docs), so e.g. it works correctly for `snowflake_function_sql` but nor for `snowflake_function_python`.

No changes in configuration are required.

### *(new feature)* Added missing `object_types` in grant resources

Previously, the `snowflake_grant_privileges_to_account_role` and `snowflake_grant_privileges_to_database_role` resources did not support all object types that Snowflake allows in GRANT statements.
With this change, we added support for the following missing object types:

- `AGENT` object type in the `on_schema_object.object_type`, `on_schema_object.all`, and `on_schema_object.future` fields
- `EXPERIMENT` object type in the `on_schema_object.object_type` field
- `GATEWAY` object type in the `on_schema_object.object_type` field
- `MCP SERVER` object type in the `on_schema_object.object_type`, `on_schema_object.all`, and `on_schema_object.future` fields
- `NOTEBOOK PROJECT` object type in the `on_schema_object.object_type` field

We also corrected the `on_schema_object.all` field validation to properly exclude `JOIN POLICY` object type, and the `on_schema_object.future` field validation to properly exclude `JOIN POLICY` and `SNAPSHOT` object types, which Snowflake does not support for bulk grants. The same restrictions apply to the newly added `GATEWAY` and `NOTEBOOK PROJECT` object types.

No changes in configuration are required.

### *(bugfix)* Fixed `snowflake_share` update failing when adding accounts to a share that already has a database granted

Previously, updating the `accounts` field on the `snowflake_share` resource (e.g., adding consumer accounts after the initial creation) would fail with:
```
│ Error: error adding accounts to share: 003033 (0A000): SQL compilation error:
│ Database 'TEMP_...' does not belong to the database that is being shared.
```
This happened because the provider always used an internal workaround that creates a temporary database and grants it to the share before adding accounts. When a real database was already granted to the share, Snowflake rejected the grant on the temporary database since only one database can be granted `USAGE` on a share at a time.

After the fix, the provider now checks whether a database is already granted to the share before adding accounts. If a database is present, accounts are added directly via `ALTER SHARE ... ADD ACCOUNTS` without the temporary database workaround.

No changes in configuration are required.

References: [#4398](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/4398).

### *(enhancement)* Fixed external change detection in user resources (`snowflake_user`, `snowflake_service_user`, and `snowflake_legacy_service_user`)

The user resources were not able to detect external changes for some string fields that were null or empty on the Snowflake side.
As an example, when you specified `email` in configuration like so:
```terraform
resource "snowflake_user" "test" {
  ...
  name = "SOME_USER"
  email = "some@email.com"
  ...
}
```

and then removed it on the snowflake side with:
```sql
ALTER USER SOME_USER UNSET EMAIL;
```

The change wasn't detected in the user resource. Now, such changes are detected. Here's the list of affected fields:
- `email`
- `default_warehouse`
- `default_role`
- `rsa_public_key`
- `rsa_public_key_2`
- `comment`
- Fields only for users with `type = PERSON`:
    - `first_name`
    - `middle_name`
    - `last_name`

No configuration changes are required.

### *(enhancement)* `snowflake_network_rule` rework

#### Changes in `type` and `mode` fields
Previously, the `type` and `mode` fields on `snowflake_network_rule` required exact uppercase values (e.g. `IPV4`, `INGRESS`). Values in any other casing would be rejected by the provider validation.

Additionally, two new `type` values are now supported:
- `GCPPSCID` - for GCP Private Service Connect endpoint identifiers
- `PRIVATE_HOST_PORT` - for private host port identifiers

Two new `mode` values are now supported:
- `POSTGRES_INGRESS` - for incoming traffic to Snowflake Postgres instances
- `POSTGRES_EGRESS` - for outgoing traffic from Snowflake Postgres instances

No configuration changes are required. Existing configurations will continue to work as before. If you were using workarounds to force uppercase values, those can be removed.

#### Identifiers related changes
Resource ID format was changed from pipe-separated to regular Snowflake identifiers (e.g. `<database_name>|<schema_name>|<network_rule_name>` -> `"<database_name>"."<schema_name>"."<network_rule_name>"`). Importing resources also needs to be adjusted:
```shell
terraform import snowflake_network_rule.example '"<database_name>"."<schema_name>"."<network_rule_name>"'
```

No change is required, the state will be migrated automatically.

#### New `show_output` and `describe_output` attributes
New computed attributes `show_output` and `describe_output` were added to the `snowflake_network_rule` resource. They contain the output of `SHOW NETWORK RULES` and `DESCRIBE NETWORK RULE` queries, respectively. They can be used to reference network rule properties in other parts of the configuration.

No configuration changes are required.

Reference: [#3956](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/3956), [#4437](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/4437)

### snowflake_network_rule promoted to stable

Since this version, this resource is stable and is enabled by default: enabling it in the provider configuration is no longer required. Please remove it from the `preview_features_enabled` list.

Provider will issue a warning if a stable feature is still used on the `preview_features_enabled` list. These values will be removed in the next major version.

Read more about preview and stable features in our [documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs#support).

### *(new feature)* snowflake_network_rules data source
Added a new preview data source for network rules. See reference [docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/show-network-rules).

This feature will be marked as a stable feature in future releases. Breaking changes are expected, even without bumping the major version. To use this feature, add `snowflake_network_rules_datasource` to `preview_features_enabled` field in the provider configuration.

### *(bugfix)* Fixed timestamp parsing in stage resources

The new stage resources introduced in v2.13.0 parsed the `last_refreshed_on` timestamp column. However, due to flexibility of the time formats, this could fail with errors like
```
│ Error: parsing time "2026-02-15 23:59:47.000 Z" as "2006-01-02 15:04:05.000 -0700": cannot parse "Z" as "-0700"
```

This caused Terraform to detect a diff on the next plan and taint the resource, potentially leading to an unwanted recreation.

This is now fixed - the provider does not parse the received timestamp. Additionally, this field can be now read in the `directory_table` schema in `describe_output`.

The state is upgraded automatically.

#### Important: untaint resources after the upgrade

If Terraform has already tainted your resources before upgrading to this version, you should untaint them to avoid unnecessary recreation:

```shell
terraform untaint snowflake_external_s3_stage.example
```

After upgrading the provider to this version, the state upgrader will take care of populating `describe_output` and no further action is needed.

Reference: [#4445](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/4445).

### *(new feature)* Import validation for `snowflake_grant_privileges_to_account_role`

A new `GRANTS_IMPORT_VALIDATION` experimental feature was added. When enabled, importing a `snowflake_grant_privileges_to_account_role` resource with a fixed set of privileges (`privileges` field) will validate that the specified privileges actually exist in Snowflake with the correct `with_grant_option` setting, and error immediately if they don't match.

It's not enabled by default and to use it, you have to enable this feature on the provider level
by adding `GRANTS_IMPORT_VALIDATION` value to the [`experimental_features_enabled`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs#experimental_features_enabled-1) provider field.
It's similar to the existing [`preview_features_enabled`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs#preview_features_enabled-1),
but instead of enabling the use of the whole resources, it's meant to slightly alter the provider's behavior.

**It's still considered a preview feature, even when applied to the stable resources.**

This feature works independently of the `GRANTS_STRICT_PRIVILEGE_MANAGEMENT` flag.

## v2.12.x ➞ v2.13.0

### *(bugfix)* Fixed `snowflake_tag_association` usage with function or procedure object types

Previously, after creating the `snowflake_tag_association` resource with functions or procedures,
any modifications to the `object_identifiers` or `tag_value` fields would lead to the following error:

```text
Error: unable to read identifier: ABC, err = parse error on line 1, column 2: extraneous or missing " in quoted-field
```

Now, it's possible to use the `snowflake_tag_association` resource with functions and procedures.

No changes in the configuration are required.

### *(new feature)* New stage resources

To enhance clarity and functionality, the new resources
- [snowflake_stage_internal](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/internal_stage),
- [snowflake_stage_external_gcs](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/external_gcs_stage),
- [snowflake_stage_external_azure](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/external_azure_stage),
- [snowflake_stage_external_s3](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/external_s3_stage),
- [snowflake_stage_external_s3_compatible](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/external_s3_compatible_stage), and
have been introduced to replace the previous `snowflake_stage` for internal and external stages.
Recognizing that the old resource carried multiple responsibilities within a single entity, we opted to divide it into more specialized resources.
The newly introduced resources are aligned with the latest Snowflake documentation at the time of implementation, and adhere to our [new conventions](#general-changes).

These features are in preview. To use them, add
- `snowflake_stage_internal_resource`,
- `snowflake_stage_external_gcs_resource`,
- `snowflake_stage_external_azure_resource`,
- `snowflake_stage_external_s3_resource`, or
- `snowflake_stage_external_s3_compatible_resource`,
to the [`preview_features_enabled`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs#preview_features_enabled-1) provider field.

The existing `snowflake_stage` resource remains available for both internal and external stages, but is now deprecated. The old resource will be removed in v3 version. The new resources are recommended for internal and external stages. See the resource documentation linked above for complete configuration details.

To achieve zero-downtime migration, please follow our [Resource migration guide](./docs/guides/resource_migration.md).

#### *(breaking change)* Stages data source

Note: this data source was in preview allowing us to make breaking changes without bumping the major version (following [our docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/terraform#preview-features)).

Reworked existing datasource enabling querying and filtering all types of stages. Notes:
- all results are stored in `stages` field.
- `like` field enables stages filtering.
- `SHOW STAGES` output is enclosed in `show_output` field inside `stages`.
- Output from `DESC STAGE` (which can be turned off by declaring `with_describe = false`, **it's turned on by default**) is enclosed in `describe_output` field inside `stages`.
  `DESC STAGE` returns different properties based on the stage and file format type. Consult the documentation to check which ones will be filled for which integration.
  It's important to limit the records and calls to Snowflake to the minimum. That's why we recommend assessing which information you need from the data source and then providing strong filters and turning off additional fields for better plan performance.

The data source is still in preview. To use it, add `snowflake_stages_datasource` to the [`preview_features_enabled`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs#preview_features_enabled-1) provider field.

### *(new feature)* Storage integrations reworked

#### *(new feature/deprecation)* Storage integration resources

Existing `snowflake_storage_integration` resource has been deprecated. It has been split into three new dedicated ones: `snowflake_storage_integration_aws`, `snowflake_storage_integration_azure`, and `snowflake_storage_integration_gcs`. These new resources have updated logic and manage only a single type of integration, simplifying the schemas (earlier, properties from all types were present in a single schema, making the resource management more complex).
The newly introduced resources are aligned with the latest Snowflake documentation at the time of implementation, and adhere to our [new conventions](#general-changes).

These resources are in preview. To use them, add `snowflake_storage_integration_aws_resource`, `snowflake_storage_integration_azure_resource`, or `snowflake_storage_integration_gcs_resource` to the [`preview_features_enabled`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs#preview_features_enabled-1) provider field.

Changes against the old `snowflake_storage_integration` resource:
- `storage_allowed_locations` and `storage_blocked_locations` changed from lists to sets in all the new resources
- `storage_provider` was not added to Azure and GCS resources
- `type` was not used in any of the new resources
- non-settable attributes moved to `show_output` or `describe_output`
- `describe_output` was flattened (it does contain only attributes with values and not list of properties as before)
- each type's schema contains only the attributes valid for the given type

To achieve zero-downtime migration, please follow our [Resource migration guide](./docs/guides/resource_migration.md).

#### *(breaking change)* Storage integration data source

Note: this data source was in preview allowing us to make breaking changes without bumping the major version (following [our docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/terraform#preview-features)).

Reworked existing datasource enabling querying and filtering all types of storage integrations. Notes:
- all results are stored in `storage_integrations` field.
- `like` field enables storage integrations filtering.
- `SHOW STORAGE INTEGRATIONS` output is enclosed in `show_output` field inside `storage_integrations`.
- Output from `DESC STORAGE INTEGRATION` (which can be turned off by declaring `with_describe = false`, **it's turned on by default**) is enclosed in `describe_output` field inside `storage_integrations`.
  `DESC STORAGE INTEGRATION` returns different properties based on the integration type. Consult the documentation to check which ones will be filled for which integration.
  The additional parameters call `DESC STORAGE INTEGRATION` (with `with_describe` turned on) **per storage integration** returned by `SHOW STORAGE INTEGRATIONS`.
  It's important to limit the records and calls to Snowflake to the minimum. That's why we recommend assessing which information you need from the data source and then providing strong filters and turning off additional fields for better plan performance.

The data source is still in preview. To use it, add `snowflake_storage_integrations_datasource` to the [`preview_features_enabled`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs#preview_features_enabled-1) provider field.

### Enhanced region mappings in `current_account` datasource

Previously, this resource was missing a number of regions for mapping in the `url` field, which may have resulted in empty field.

In this change, we expanded the supported Snowflake region mappings to include additional cloud regions:

#### AWS
| Region Key | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `aws_us_gov_west_2` | US Gov West 2 |
| `aws_us_gov_west_1_fhplus` | US Gov West 1 FedRAMP High+ |
| `aws_us_gov_west_1_dod` | US Gov West 1 DoD |
| `aws_us_gov_east_1` | US Gov East 1 |
| `aws_us_gov_east_1_fhplus` | US Gov East 1 FedRAMP High+ |
| `aws_af_south_1` | Africa South 1 |
| `aws_eu_central_2` | EU Central 2 |
| `aws_ap_southeast_3` | AP Southeast 3 |
| `aws_cn_northwest_1` | China Northwest 1 (also returns snowflakecomputing.cn domain) |

#### GCP
| Region Key | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `gcp_europe_west3` | Europe West 3 |
| `gcp_me_central2` | Middle East Central 2 |

#### Azure
| Region Key | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `azure_usgovvirginia_fhplus` | US Gov Virginia FedRAMP High+ |
| `azure_mexicocentral` | Mexico Central |
| `azure_swedencentral` | Sweden Central |
| `azure_koreacentral` | Korea Central |

Read more in the [Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-account-identifier#non-vps-account-locator-formats-by-cloud-platform-and-region).

Note that this resource is still in preview.

### *(new feature)* Workload Identity Federation support for service users

Added `default_workload_identity` configuration block to `snowflake_service_user` and `snowflake_legacy_service_user` resources. This enables passwordless authentication using cloud provider workload identities (AWS, Azure, GCP, or generic OIDC).

Example configuration using OIDC:

```hcl
resource "snowflake_service_user" "example" {
  name = "SERVICE_USER"

  default_workload_identity {
    oidc {
      issuer             = "https://accounts.google.com"
      subject            = "system:serviceaccount:namespace:sa-name"
      oidc_audience_list = ["https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth"]
    }
  }
}
```

See the [service_user](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/service_user) and [legacy_service_user](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/legacy_service_user) documentation for all provider types (AWS, Azure, GCP, OIDC) and configuration details.

It's not enabled by default and to use it, you have to enable this feature on the provider level
by adding `USER_ENABLE_DEFAULT_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY` value to the [`experimental_features_enabled`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/2.12.0/docs#experimental_features_enabled-1) provider field.
It's similar to the existing [`preview_features_enabled`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/2.12.0/docs#preview_features_enabled-1),
but instead of enabling the use of the whole resources, it's meant to slightly alter the provider's behavior.

If you don't use WIF for your users, no changes in configuration are required for existing service users. If you had WIF set up externally, please enable the new feature and add the `default_workload_identity` block to manage WIFs with Terraform. If the feature is enabled, and the configuration is not adjusted, the provider will unset the WIF on a given user.

References: [#3942](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/3942).

### Handling deprecated `mfa_authentication_methods` field in authentication policies
The 2025_06 bundle is now generally enabled. As we previously explained in the [BCR Migration Guide](./SNOWFLAKE_BCR_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md#changes-in-authentication-policies), the MFA authentication methods have been deprecated in that bundle.

Now, the `mfa_authentication_methods` field in the authentication_policy resource has no effect, and the plan on this field will always be empty. It will be removed in v3. Please use `mfa_policy.enforce_mfa_on_external_authentication` instead.

You may remove the `mfa_authentication_methods` field from the authentication_policy resource.

### *(improvement)* Using UNSET for certain fields in warehouses
Previously, Snowflake didn't support `UNSET` for `scaling_policy`, `auto_resume`, and `warehouse_type` in warehouses. As a workaround, the provider used `SET` with default values.
Now, `UNSET` is available in Snowflake, and the provider uses this operation for these fields.

Note: `auto_suspend` still uses `SET` with the default value (600) as a workaround, because `UNSET` returns 0 instead of the default.

No changes in the configuration is required.

### *(bugfix)* Fixed `snowflake_system_get_privatelink_config` and `snowflake_system_get_aws_sns_iam_policy` data sources with `QUOTED_IDENTIFIERS_IGNORE_CASE` enabled

Previously, both data sources returned null values for all fields when an account had the `QUOTED_IDENTIFIERS_IGNORE_CASE` parameter set to `true`. This was caused by a case mismatch between the SQL column aliases and the internal struct field mappings.

The data sources now work correctly regardless of the `QUOTED_IDENTIFIERS_IGNORE_CASE` setting.

Note that these data sources are still in preview.

No changes in configuration are required.

References: [#1630](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/1630)

### *(bugfix)* Fixed broken state after errors in `terraform apply` in the schema resource
Previously, when the schema's `with_managed_access` value was changed during the apply, and the Terraform role did not have sufficient privileges, the operation resulted in a corrupted state. The value of such a field was set to `true` in the state, even though the operation returned an error. This behavior could also happen in other fields.

In this release, this bug has been fixed. After failing Terraform operations, the state should be preserved correctly.

If you previously ended up in a corrupted state, you can remove the resource from the state and reimport it using `terraform import`.

No changes in configuration are required.

### *(new experiment)* Reduce the `parameters` output

Currently, the `parameters` field in various resources contains a verbatim output for the `SHOW PARAMETERS IN <object>` command. One of the fields contained in the output is the `description`. It does not change and is repeated for all objects containing the given parameter. It leads to an excessive output (check e.g., [#3118](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/3118)).

To mitigate the problem, we are adding this option to reduce the output to only `value` and `level` fields, which should significantly reduce the state size. **Note**: it's also affecting the `parameters` output for data sources.

We considered the option to remove the `parameters` output completely, however, we plan to change the external change logic detection to use it (to make it consistent with other attributes using `show_output` and because we won't be able to implement the current logic when switching to the Terraform Plugin Framework) and it still allows referencing the parameter value/level from other parts of the configuration.

It's not enabled by default and to use it, you have to enable this feature on the provider level
by adding `PARAMETERS_REDUCED_OUTPUT` value to the [`experimental_features_enabled`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/2.12.0/docs#experimental_features_enabled-1) provider field.
It's similar to the existing [`preview_features_enabled`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/2.12.0/docs#preview_features_enabled-1),
but instead of enabling the use of the whole resources, it's meant to slightly alter the provider's behavior.

**It's still considered a preview feature, even when applied to the stable resources.**

Affected data sources:
- `snowflake_databases`
- `snowflake_schemas`
- `snowflake_tasks`
- `snowflake_users`
- `snowflake_warehouses`

Affected resources:
- `snowflake_external_oauth_integration`
- `snowflake_oauth_integration_for_custom_clients`
- `snowflake_oauth_integration_for_partner_applications`
- `snowflake_schema`
- `snowflake_task`
- `snowflake_user`
- `snowflake_service_user`
- `snowflake_legacy_service_user`
- `snowflake_warehouse`
- `snowflake_function_java`
- `snowflake_function_javascript`
- `snowflake_function_python`
- `snowflake_function_scala`
- `snowflake_function_sql`
- `snowflake_procedure_java`
- `snowflake_procedure_javascript`
- `snowflake_procedure_python`
- `snowflake_procedure_scala`
- `snowflake_procedure_sql`

References: [#3118](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/3118)

## v2.11.x ➞ v2.12.0

### *(new feature)* The new `strict_privilege_management` flag in the `snowflake_grant_privileges_to_account_role` resource

The new `strict_privilege_management` flag was added to the `snowflake_grant_privileges_to_account_role` resource.
It has similar behavior to the `enable_multiple_grants` flag present in the old grant resources,
and it makes the resource able to detect external changes for privileges other than those present in the configuration,
which can make the `snowflake_grant_privileges_to_account_role` resource a central point of knowledge privilege management
for a given object and role.

It's not enabled by default and to use it, you have to enable this feature on the provider level
by adding `GRANTS_STRICT_PRIVILEGE_MANAGEMENT` value to the [`experimental_features_enabled`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs#experimental_features_enabled-1) provider field.
It's similar to the existing [`preview_features_enabled`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/2.10.0/docs#preview_features_enabled-1),
but instead of enabling the use of the whole resources, it's meant to slightly alter the provider's behavior.

**It's still considered a preview feature, even when applied to the stable resources.**

Read more in our [strict privilege management](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/guides/strict_privilege_management) guide.

### *(breaking change)* The removal of `SAML_IDENTITY_PROVIDER` from `snowflake_current_account` and `snowflake_current_organization_account` resources

Due to changes on the Snowflake side, the `SAML_IDENTITY_PROVIDER` parameter is now deprecated and cannot be used in Snowflake (see [Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/parameters#saml-identity-provider)).
Because of this, we have removed support for this parameter in the `snowflake_current_account` and `snowflake_current_organization_account` resources.
Both of the resources are in preview, so we decided to introduce this change now despite being a breaking change as it makes those resources unusable without workarounds (see related issue).

If you were using this parameter in your configuration, please follow instructions in the linked documentation to migrate away from it.
If you were not using this parameter, no changes are required.

Related: [#4010](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/4010)

### *(new feature)* New proxy configuration options in the provider

We added new provider configuration options to support proxy connections. These fields allow the driver to connect through an HTTP/HTTPS proxy:
- `proxy_host` - the hostname of the proxy server
- `proxy_port` - the port of the proxy server
- `proxy_user` - the username for proxy authentication (if required)
- `proxy_password` - the password for proxy authentication (if required)
- `proxy_protocol` - the protocol used by the proxy (`http` or `https`)
- `no_proxy` - a comma-separated list of hostnames that should bypass the proxy

These options can be set in the provider configuration, TOML configuration file, or via environment variables (`SNOWFLAKE_PROXY_HOST`, `SNOWFLAKE_PROXY_PORT`, `SNOWFLAKE_PROXY_USER`, `SNOWFLAKE_PROXY_PASSWORD`, `SNOWFLAKE_PROXY_PROTOCOL`, `SNOWFLAKE_NO_PROXY`). Read [the documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs#schema) for more details.

No changes in configuration are required for existing setups. You can optionally update your configurations to use these new options if you need to connect through a proxy.

### *(new feature)* New certificate revocation and SAML configuration options in the provider

We added new provider configuration options to support certificate revocation checking and SAML URL validation:
- `disable_ocsp_checks` - when set to `true` (default is `false`), the driver doesn't check certificate revocation status. This is a replacement for the deprecated `insecure_mode` field
- `cert_revocation_check_mode` - specifies the certificate revocation check mode. Valid options are: `DISABLED`, `ADVISORY`, `ENABLED`
- `crl_allow_certificates_without_crl_url` - allows certificates (not short-lived) without CRL DP included to be treated as correct ones
- `crl_in_memory_cache_disabled` - when set to `true`, the CRL in-memory cache is disabled (default `false`)
- `crl_on_disk_cache_disabled` - when set to `true`, the CRL on-disk cache is disabled (default `false`)
- `crl_http_client_timeout` - timeout in seconds for HTTP client used to download CRL
- `disable_saml_url_check` - indicates whether the SAML URL check should be disabled

These options can be set in the provider configuration, TOML configuration file, or via environment variables (`SNOWFLAKE_DISABLE_OCSP_CHECKS`, `SNOWFLAKE_CERT_REVOCATION_CHECK_MODE`, `SNOWFLAKE_CRL_ALLOW_CERTIFICATES_WITHOUT_CRL_URL`, `SNOWFLAKE_CRL_IN_MEMORY_CACHE_DISABLED`, `SNOWFLAKE_CRL_ON_DISK_CACHE_DISABLED`, `SNOWFLAKE_CRL_HTTP_CLIENT_TIMEOUT`, `SNOWFLAKE_DISABLE_SAML_URL_CHECK`). Read [the documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs#schema) for more details.

No changes in configuration are required for existing setups. You can optionally update your configurations to use these new options if you need more control over certificate revocation checking or SAML authentication.

### *(new feature)* snowflake_listings datasource
Added a new preview data source for listings. See reference [docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/show-listings).

This data source focuses on base query commands (SHOW LISTINGS and DESCRIBE LISTING). Other query commands like SHOW AVAILABLE LISTINGS, DESCRIBE AVAILABLE LISTING, SHOW LISTING OFFERS, SHOW OFFERS, SHOW PRICING PLANS, and SHOW VERSIONS IN LISTING are not included and will be added depending on demand.

This feature will be marked as a stable feature in future releases. Breaking changes are expected, even without bumping the major version. To use this feature, add `snowflake_listings_datasource` to `preview_features_enabled` field in the provider configuration.

### *(new feature)* Added serverless task parameters
Added support for new serverless task fields:
- `target_completion_interval` - Specifies the target completion interval for serverless tasks; also added as a computed value to `show_output`.
- `serverless_task_min_statement_size` (parameter) - Minimum statement size for serverless tasks; also added as a computed value to `parameters`.
- `serverless_task_max_statement_size` (parameter) - Maximum statement size for serverless tasks; also added as a computed value to `parameters`.

These fields are available in the `snowflake_task` resource for serverless task configurations.

No changes in configuration are required for existing tasks. You can optionally update your configurations to use these new parameters.

### *(improvement)* snowflake_scim_integration now accepts custom role names for run_as_role

Previously, the `run_as_role` field in the [snowflake_scim_integration](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/2.11.0/docs/resources/scim_integration) resource only accepted predefined role names: `OKTA_PROVISIONER`, `AAD_PROVISIONER`, or `GENERIC_SCIM_PROVISIONER`.

Now, the field accepts any custom role name, allowing you to use organization-specific roles for SCIM provisioning. This field is now case-sensitive. The exception is if you set any of `okta_provisioner`, `aad_provisioner`, or `generic_scim_provisioner`.
To maintain compatibility and avoid breaking changes, for these values, the provider makes them uppercase (like it was doing before). This will be changed in the v3 version of the provider (the field will behave like all other identifier fields).
- If you use `OKTA_PROVISIONER`, `AAD_PROVISIONER`, or `GENERIC_SCIM_PROVISIONER` roles in Snowflake, please make them uppercase in your configuration (this will result in an empty plan).
- If you use `okta_provisioner`, `aad_provisioner`, or `generic_scim_provisioner` roles in Snowflake, please handle them in provider with snowflake_execute, or rename the roles entirely.

Existing configurations using predefined roles will continue to work without modifications, but please bear in mind the potential case-sensitive changes in v3.

References: [#3917](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/3917).

### *(improvement)* New fields in user resources and data sources output fields
We adjusted the `show_output` by adding the missing `has_workload_identity` field. This concerns `user`, `service_user`, and `legacy_service_user` resources and `users` data source.

### *(bugfix)* Fixed handling grants to APPLICATION in SHOW GRANTS
Previously, when a database role was granted to an application, the provider did not handle the `SHOW GRANTS OF DATABASE ROLE` output correctly. This caused failures in conversion,
and in the `grant_database_role` resource, the Read operation failed. Since the provider could not read the grants for the given resource, the resource was being marked as deleted.
The Terraform plan and apply operations returned errors like
```
│ Error: Provider produced inconsistent result after apply
│
│ When applying changes to snowflake_grant_database_role.database_roles, provider "provider[\"registry.terraform.io/snowflakedb/snowflake\"]" produced an unexpected new value: Root object was present, but now absent.
│
│ This is a bug in the provider, which should be reported in the provider's own issue tracker.
```

In this release, this bug has been fixed. The `SHOW GRANTS...` output is converted correctly, and the resource is not marked as removed, which does not result in such error anymore.
This fix also applies to other grants resources.

No changes in configuration are required.

References: [#4284](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/4284).

### *(bugfix)* authentication policies data sources
Snowflake recently introduced a new, default authentication policy at the account level, which is applied when no user-defined policy is set.

This issue could cause `snowflake_authentication_policies` data source to fail with errors similar to the following:

```
sql: Scan error on column index 0, name "created_on": unsupported Scan, storing driver.Value type <nil> into type *time.Time
```

The internal implementation for authentication policy has now been updated to handle and skip built-in entities.

**Impact on the provider:**
The built-in policy does not reside in a database and schema. As it can't be directly interacted with, we decided to treat this default transparently:
- It won't be visible in the outputs for the `snowflake_authentication_policies` data source; if you query for authentication policies (with either `on.account` or `on.user` filtering options)
  and only the built-in policy exists (no user-defined policies), the data source will return empty `show_output` and `describe_output` lists.
  If you have user-defined authentication policies, they will continue to appear in the output as expected.
- It can't be imported into the `snowflake_authentication_policy` resource.

If you rely on the outputs from the `snowflake_authentication_policies` data source and use either `on.account` or `on.user` filtering options,
make sure your configuration now accounts for missing outputs whenever no user-defined authentication policy is set.

## v2.10.x ➞ v2.11.0

### *(new feature)* Notebooks preview feature

#### Added resource
Added a new preview resource for managing notebooks. See reference [docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-notebook).

This feature will be marked as a stable feature in future releases. Breaking changes are expected, even without bumping the major version. To use this feature, add `snowflake_notebook_resource` to `preview_features_enabled` field in the provider configuration.

#### Added data source
Added a new preview data source for notebooks. See reference [docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/show-notebooks).

This feature will be marked as a stable feature in future releases. Breaking changes are expected, even without bumping the major version. To use this feature, add `snowflake_notebooks_datasource` to `preview_features_enabled` field in the provider configuration.

### *(new feature)* Semantic views preview feature

This version of the provider introduces support for the `SEMANTIC VIEWS`. Check the [official Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/views-semantic/overview) to know more.

You can enable resource and data source by adding `snowflake_semantic_view_resource` or `snowflake_semantic_views_datasource` to `preview_features_enabled` field in the provider configuration. You can read about the resource and data source current limitations in the documentation in the registry.

This feature will be marked as a stable feature in future releases. Breaking changes are expected, even without bumping the major version.

#### Add support for semantic views in `snowflake_grant_ownership` resource
Add a missing option in `snowflake_grant_ownership` to support semantic views (see [Snowflake docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/grant-ownership)).

### *(improvement)* Upgraded gosnowflake driver to v1.18.0

The provider now uses [gosnowflake driver v1.18.0](https://github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake).

**Important note about query logging:** With this driver version, queries are not logged by default. If you need query-level debugging, ensure you configure appropriate logging settings.

We added new provider configuration options to control query logging behavior:
  - `log_query_text` - when set to `true`, query text will be logged
  - `log_query_parameters` - when set to `true`, query parameters will be logged

These options can be set in the provider configuration, TOML configuration file, or via environment variables. Read [the documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs#schema) for more details.

Note that you still need to set the `INFO` level in `driver_tracing` field to see the query logs.

**Note:** Enabling these options may log sensitive information. Use with caution and ensure appropriate security measures are in place.

References: [#4092](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/4092).

### *(new feature)* Added missing `object_types` in grant resources

Previously, the following resources did not support all object types that can be specified in `snowflake_grant_privileges_to_account_role` and `snowflake_grant_privileges_to_database_role` resources.
With this change, we added support for the following missing object types:

In the `snowflake_grant_privileges_to_account_role` resource, we enabled support for:
- `CONNECTION` object type in the `on_account_object.object_type` field
- `ONLINE FEATURE TABLE` object type in the `on_schema_object.object_type`, `on_schema_object.all`, and `on_schema_object.future` fields
- `STORAGE LIFECYCLE POLICY` and `WORKSPACE` object type in the `on_schema_object.object_type` field

In the `snowflake_grant_privileges_to_database_role` resource, we enabled support for:
- `ONLINE FEATURE TABLE` object type in the `on_schema_object.object_type`, `on_schema_object.all`, and `on_schema_object.future` fields
- `STORAGE LIFECYCLE POLICY` and `WORKSPACE` object type in the `on_schema_object.object_type` field

### *(improvement)* `describe_output` will now recompute whenever `comment` field is changed in secret resources

Previously, in the following resources:
- `snowflake_secret_with_generic_string`
- `snowflake_secret_with_basic_authentication`
- `snowflake_secret_with_oauth_authorization_code`
- `snowflake_secret_with_client_credentials`

when the `comment` field was changed, the `describe_output` field was not recomputed, although it contains the `comment` field.
Now, changing the `comment` field will trigger recomputing the `describe_output` field. It doesn't affect current resource behavior
(in terms of applying or ignoring changes on the actual Snowflake object), but keeps the consistency with logic in other resources.

No changes in configuration and state are required.

### *(improvement)* Functions reading TOML configuration now clean path

Previously, the provider's file reading functions did not clean paths. In this version, all functions handling files use Go's [filepath.Clean](https://pkg.go.dev/path/filepath#Clean) function for each file path.

No changes in configuration and state are required. The supported TOML location `~/.snowflake/config` stays the same and the behavior shouldn't be affected.

### Task parameter validation handling

Recently, Snowflake moved validation from runtime (task execution) to CREATE/ALTER operations for two parameters ([`AUTOCOMMIT`](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/parameters#autocommit) and [`SEARCH_PATH`](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/parameters#search-path)).
Because of this, both parameters for tasks fail during those operations for invalid values.
The `AUTOCOMMIT` parameter can be only set to `TRUE` (default value for this parameter), and `SEARCH_PATH` cannot be set at all. Both parameters can be unset.
Now, when either `AUTOCOMMIT` is set to `FALSE` or `SEARCH_PATH` is set in the configuration (when creating or changing), the task resource will return warnings saying:

```
Invalid value for AUTOCOMMIT parameter: cannot be set to FALSE on a task
Invalid value for SEARCH_PATH parameter: cannot be set on a task
```

If you have any of these parameters set in your configuration,
please remove them to avoid the Terraform warnings and potential errors from the Snowflake side.
The parameters may be removed in the next major version of the provider.
Other than this, no changes in the configuration are required.

### *(bugfix)* Adjusted `oauth_allowed_scopes` handling in api integration resources (`snowflake_api_integration_with_client_credentials` and `snowflake_api_integration_with_oauth_authorization_code`)

Both resources had incorrect handling of the `oauth_allowed_scopes` field during updates.
The parameter can be set on the Snowflake side, but it cannot be unset (or set to an empty value).
The resources were adjusted to correctly handle this behavior and propose to recreate the resource in case the field was set to an empty value.

No changes in configuration are required.

### *(bugfix)* Improved validation of identifiers with arguments
Previously, during parsing identifiers with argument types, when the identifier format was incorrect, the provider could panic with errors like:
```
Stack trace from the terraform-provider-snowflake_v2.8.0 plugin:

panic: runtime error: index out of range [1] with length 1

goroutine 142 [running]:
github.com/Snowflake-Labs/terraform-provider-snowflake/pkg/sdk.ParseSchemaObjectIdentifierWithArguments({0x14000ff3a40, 0x28})
github.com/Snowflake-Labs/terraform-provider-snowflake/pkg/sdk/identifier_parsers.go:164 +0x2bc
```
This could happen when e.g. the passed identifier was using the old pipe-separated format.

In this version, the provider validates the expected number of parts, so the error message is like this:
```
unexpected number of parts 1 in identifier abc|def|ghi(varchar), expected 3 in a form of "<database_name>.<schema_name>.<schema_object_name>(<argname> <argtype>...)>" where <argname> is optional
```
No changes in configuration are required.

### *(bugfix)* Disallowed setting `DATABASE ROLES` object type on `all` and `future` fields in `snowflake_grant_ownership` resource
Previously, the provider allowed setting the `DATABASE ROLES` object type on `all` and `future` fields in the `grant_ownership` resource.
This operation is not allowed in Snowflake, and such resource configuration resulted in errors being returned from Snowflake.

In this version, the provider does not allow setting the `DATABASE ROLES` object type on `all` and `future` fields in the `grant_ownership` resource.
In a few releases, we will address other similar faulty object type cases in privilege-granting resources.

No changes in configuration are required.

Community PR: [#4185](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/pull/4185)

### *(new feature)* Task seconds and hours scheduling support

Added support for scheduling tasks using seconds and hours intervals in addition to the existing minutes and cron support. The `snowflake_task` resource now supports:

- `schedule.seconds` - Schedule tasks to run at intervals specified in seconds (e.g., every 30 seconds)
- `schedule.hours` - Schedule tasks to run at intervals specified in hours (e.g., every 2 hours)

These new scheduling options work alongside the existing `schedule.minutes` and `schedule.using_cron` options. Only one scheduling method can be specified at a time.

**Example usage:**

```terraform
resource "snowflake_task" "example_seconds" {
  database      = "my_database"
  schema        = "my_schema"
  name          = "my_task_seconds"
  sql_statement = "SELECT 1"
  started       = true

  schedule {
    seconds = 30  # Run every 30 seconds
  }
}

resource "snowflake_task" "example_hours" {
  database      = "my_database"
  schema        = "my_schema"
  name          = "my_task_hours"
  sql_statement = "SELECT 1"
  started       = true

  schedule {
    hours = 2  # Run every 2 hours
  }
}
```

### *(improvement)* Handling show_output in warehouses

In v2.7.0 ([migration guide](./MIGRATION_GUIDE.md#new-feature-added-support-for-generation-2-standard-warehouses-and-resource-constraints-for-snowpark-optimized-warehouses)),
we added support for gen2 warehouses. In this change, we added new fields to `show_output`: `generation`, and `resource_constraint`. Before the 2025_07 bundle, the `generation` column was not available in `SHOW WAREHOUSES`. Internally, we dispatched
`resource_constraint` value based on the warehouse type, and filled the values in the resource state.

The 2025_07 bundle adds the `generation` column (read our [BCR Migration Guide](./SNOWFLAKE_BCR_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md#new-generation-column-in-output-in-show-warehouses)). Now, instead of dispatching the `resource_constraint` value, the provider simply passes the `generation` field from Snowflake to the `show_output`.
If the bundle is disabled, then the `generation` column is not present in Snowflake, and the providers behaves in the old way.

No changes in the configuration are necessary.

### *(improvement)* Granting privileges on a database during share update

When updating the `accounts` field in the `share` resource, the provider creates a temporary database from the share. Before, it granted only the `USAGE` grant. Now, it also grants `REFERENCE_USAGE` because of the changes in the [2025_07](./SNOWFLAKE_BCR_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md#disallow-grant-reference_usage-on-a-database-if-grant-usage-isnt-set-first) bundle.

No changes in the configuration are necessary.

## v2.10.0 ➞ v2.10.1

### *(bugfix)* Fixed parsing DESCRIBE output for authentication policies

In v2.10.0, we reworked authentication policies. This release contains a regression for handling `REQUIRED_SNOWFLAKE_UI_PASSWORD_ONLY` value in `MFA_ENROLLMENT` field. For such objects, the provider returned an error
```
Error: invalid MFA enrollment option: REQUIRED_SNOWFLAKE_UI_PASSWORD_ONLY
```

This bug is now fixed. Also, we kindly remind you about [deprecation of single-factor password sign-ins](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/security-mfa-rollout).

References [#4093](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/4093#issuecomment-3480743221).

### *(bugfix)* Fixed reading the value of `oauth_refresh_token_validity` in `snowflake_oauth_integration_for_custom_clients` resource

Previously, whenever we detected an external change in the `oauth_refresh_token_validity` field,
we were trying to set it with inappropriate type causing errors like:
```
panic: oauth_refresh_token_validity: '' expected type 'int', got unconvertible type 'string', value: '86400'
```

No changes in configuration and state are required.

### *(bugfix)* Fixed updating the value of `enabled` in `snowflake_oauth_integration_for_partner_applications` resource

Previously, whenever we detected change for the `enabled` field,
we were wrongly checking the state of the `oauth_issue_refresh_tokens` field.
Although the fields' logic is connected (see the note in https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-security-integration-oauth-snowflake#additional-optional-parameters-partner-applications), it didn't matter in this context.
This could cause issues like infinite loops in plans when only the `enabled` field was changed,
but couldn't because the state of the `oauth_issue_refresh_tokens` prevented from it.

No changes in configuration and state are required.

### New Go version and conflicts with Suricata-based firewalls (like AWS Network Firewall) - changes caused by Go 1.24
Previously, when we bumped the Go version to v1.23.6 in provider version v1.0.4, it caused problems for certain firewall setups - read the [v1.0.4 migration guide](#new-go-version-and-conflicts-with-suricata-based-firewalls-like-aws-network-firewall).

In this version we bumped our underlying Go version to v1.24.9. To mitigate this issue, the GODEBUG environment variable must be set to `GODEBUG=tlsmlkem=0`, instead of `GODEBUG=tlskyber=0`. Read GODEBUG [documentation](https://go.dev/doc/godebug#go-124) for more details.

### *(bugfix)* Fixed setting comment in secret resources

Previously, when external changes were detected on comment field, the secret resources were failing to update it due to incorrect internal update operation handling.
The resources were throwing errors like:
```text
Error: 001003 (42000): SQL compilation error:
syntax error line 1 at position 248 unexpected '<EOF>'.
```

or

```text
Error: Saved plan is stale
```

Now, this behavior is fixed. Here's the list of affected resources:
- `snowflake_secret_with_generic_string`
- `snowflake_secret_with_basic_authentication`
- `snowflake_secret_with_oauth_authorization_code`
- `snowflake_secret_with_client_credentials`

No changes in configuration and state are required.

## v2.9.x ➞ v2.10.0

### *(improvement)* Features promoted to stable

The following resources/data sources were marked stable:
- `snowflake_compute_pool_resource`
- `snowflake_compute_pools_datasource`
- `snowflake_git_repository_resource`
- `snowflake_git_repositories_datasource`
- `snowflake_image_repository_resource`
- `snowflake_image_repositories_datasource`
- `snowflake_listing_resource`
- `snowflake_service_resource`
- `snowflake_services_datasource`
- `snowflake_user_programmatic_access_token_resource`
- `snowflake_user_programmatic_access_tokens_datasource`

Since this version, these features are enabled by default: enabling them in the provider configuration is no longer required. Please remove them from the `preview_features` list. Provider will issue a warning if a stable feature is still used on the `preview_features_enabled` list. These values will be removed in the next major version.

Read more about preview and stable features in our [documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs#support).

### *(new feature)* New Workload Identity Federation authentication option
We added new `WORKLOAD_IDENTITY` option to the `authenticator` field in the provider. Additionally, the provider has new fields that directly pass the values to the Go driver:
  - `workload_identity_provider` - required,
  - `token` - optional (not relevant for all the flows),
  - `workload_identity_entra_resource` - optional (only relevant for the WIF authentication on Azure environment case),
The provider does not validate these fields.

This feature enables authentication with the `WORKLOAD_IDENTITY` authenticator in the Go driver. Read more in our [Authentication methods](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/guides/authentication_methods) guide.
See [Snowflake official documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/workload-identity-federation) for more information on WIF authentication.

### *(new feature)* Reworked authentication policies
In this version we reworked the `authentication_policy` resource and added missing `authentication_policies` data source.
This includes adding missing features, and fixing bugs.
The object has been adjusted to our [design decisions](./v1-preparations/CHANGES_BEFORE_V1.md).
Note that this resource is not yet stable. We are planning to mark it as stable in the upcoming months.

#### Missing values in resource
We added missing values to the following fields:
- `authentication_methods` now allows setting `PROGRAMMATIC_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `WORKLOAD_IDENTITY`, references https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/4006,
- `client_types` now allows setting `SNOWFLAKE_CLI`, references https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/3391.

Also, we added support for the following features: `pat_policy`, `mfa_policy` and `workload_identity_policy`. Check the resource documentation for more details.

#### Handling deprecated `mfa_authentication_methods` field
As we previously explained in the [BCR Migration Guide](./SNOWFLAKE_BCR_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md#changes-in-authentication-policies), the MFA authentication methods are handled in a different way.
Now, the provider does not cause a permadiff caused by the `mfa_authentication_methods` field.
If you used the `ignore_changes` attribute, you may now remove it.
Configuring this field is still possible, but only with disabled 2025_06.

#### Fixed renaming in resource
This object supports renaming. It was also available in the provider, but did not work correctly due to a bug in name parsing. This has been fixed.

#### Changes in output fields
We adjusted the `show_output` by adding the missing `kind` field. Also, we adjusted the `describe_output` by adding the missing `mfa_policy`, `pat_policy`, and `workload_identity_policy` fields.

The state is migrated automatically.

#### Miscellaneous changes
- Improved the resource documentation.
- Added a diff suppression on `mfa_enrollment` field. This field is now case-insensitive.
- Added a trigger for showing changes `show_output`, `describe_output` and `fully_qualified_name` fields. Now, when a related field is changed in the plan, the output field may be shown as `known after apply`.
- Improved importing - now, `authentication_methods`, `mfa_enrollment`, `client_types`, and `security_integrations` are set in import.
- Improved detecting of external changes.

#### Added data source
Added a new preview data source for authentication policies.
See reference [docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/show-authentication-policies).

This feature will be marked as a stable feature in future releases.
Breaking changes are expected, even without bumping the major version. To use this feature, add `snowflake_authentication_policies_datasource` to `preview_features_enabled` field in the provider configuration.

### *(new feature)* New instance families in the compute_pool resource
Added missing instance families that are available in Snowflake: `CPU_X64_SL`, `GPU_GCP_NV_L4_1_24G`, `GPU_GCP_NV_L4_4_24G`, and `GPU_GCP_NV_A100_8_40G`.

### *(new experiment)* Improved show query for warehouses

In this version we introduce a new attribute on the provider level: [`experimental_features_enabled`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/2.10.0/docs#experimental_features_enabled-1). It's similar to the existing [`preview_features_enabled`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/2.10.0/docs#preview_features_enabled-1). Instead of enabling the use of the whole resources, it's meant to slightly alter the provider's behavior. **It's still considered a preview feature, even when applied to the stable resources.**

We treat the available values as experiments, that may become stable feature/behavior in the future provider releases if successful.

In this version, the only available experiment is `WAREHOUSE_SHOW_IMPROVED_PERFORMANCE`. When enabled, it uses a slightly different SHOW query to read warehouse details. It's meant to improve the performance for accounts with many warehouses.

Details:
- The query after enabling the experiment should look like this: `SHOW WAREHOUSES LIKE '<identifier>' STARTS WITH '<identifier>' LIMIT 1`.
- The optimization should work correctly independently of the identifier casing.

Feedback:
- If you have a lot of warehouses, and you have performance concerns when managing them, this experiment may be the solution.
- If you discover that the performance is boosted when the experiment is enabled, please reach out to us and share it! Your feedback is crucial in making the experiment an official feature of the provider.
- In case of any issues, reach out to us through GitHub or your account representative.

### *(improvement)* Handling generation attribute in warehouses

Previously, when the `generation` field was set for a given resource, the provider used the `RESOURCE_CONSTRAINT` field available in Snowflake syntax, with a proper value conversion. Now, the `GENERATION` syntax is available in Snowflake. The provider uses the new `GENERATION` syntax for the `generation` field. The behavior of `resource_constraint` field is the same.
We recommend upgrading to this version because setting generation through the `resource_constraint` field may be not supported by Snowflake in future.

No changes in the configuration are necessary.

## v2.8.x ➞ v2.9.0

### *(preview feature/deprecation)* Deprecated `mfa_authentication_methods` field in authentication policies

The `mfa_authentication_methods` field in authentication policies is already deprecated in Snowflake since 2025_06 BCR - [check our BCR Migration Guide](./SNOWFLAKE_BCR_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md#changes-in-authentication-policies).

Please follow the linked guide for more information and migration steps.

This field will be removed in the future. The new field `ENFORCE_MFA_ON_EXTERNAL_AUTHENTICATION` will be added in the next versions of the provider.

### *(new feature)* New authentication options for Oauth with Client Credentials and Oauth with Authorization Code flows

We added new `OAUTH_CLIENT_CREDENTIALS` and `OAUTH_AUTHORIZATION_CODE` options to the `authenticator` field in the provider. Additionally, the provider has new fields that directly pass the values to the Go driver:
- Fields for both authenticators
  - `oauth_client_id` - required,
  - `oauth_client_secret` - required,
  - `oauth_token_request_url` - required,
  - `oauth_scope` - optional,
- Fields only for `OAUTH_AUTHORIZATION_CODE`
  - `oauth_authorization_url` - required,
  - `oauth_redirect_uri` - required,
  - `enable_single_use_refresh_tokens` - optional, only for Snowflake IdP,
The provider does not validate these fields, but a number of them is required by the OAuth specification.

This feature enables authentication with `OAUTH_CLIENT_CREDENTIALS` and `OAUTH_AUTHORIZATION_CODE` authenticators in the Go driver. Read more in our [Authentication methods](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/guides/authentication_methods) guide.

See [Snowflake official documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/oauth-intro) for more information on Oauth authentication.

### *(bugfix)* Fixed setting the default authenticator for the `token` field

In [v2.5.0](#bugfix-fixed-incorrect-authenticator-when-using-the-token-field), we fixed a bug: when the `token` and the `authenticator` fields were both set, the provider always set the `authenticator` to `OAUTH` regardless of the `authenticator` config value.

Unfortunately, this change introduced a regression. After the fix, when the TOML profile is empty, the `authenticator` is not set to `OAUTH` when it is not in the Terraform configuration. This behavior occurred only when the TOML configuration file could not be read during initialization, and the `profile` was unset or set to `default`.

Now, the behavior is the following:
- When only `token` is set, the provider sets the default authenticator to `OAUTH`.
- When both `token` and `authenticator` are set, the `authenticator` value overrides the provider's default.

Note that in v3, we are planning to remove the logic for setting the default authenticator in the provider based on other fields.

## v2.7.x ➞ v2.8.0


### *(new feature)* Added handling private link in S3 and Azure storage integrations

Snowflake offers using private link in S3 and Azure storage integration. In this version, we added a new `use_privatelink_endpoint` field for handling this field in Snowflake.

No changes in configuration and state are required. You can optionally update your configurations by explicitly setting the `use_privatelink_endpoint` field in the `snowflake_storage_integration` resource.

Additionally, in this change we dropped validating combinations of provider-specific fields with storage providers during the update, e.g. setting `azure_tenant_id` for the AWS provider. We clarified in the documentation that the users are responsible for passing correct configurations. We are planning to introduce separate resources for each provider in the future.

Note that this resource remains in preview.

### *(new feature)* Added missing object types in privilege-granting resources

As Snowflake constantly evolves, new object types are supported in `GRANT` commands. To keep up with these changes, we adjusted the following resources:
- `snowflake_grant_privileges_to_account_role` (all object types that can be specified in `on_schema_object` block)
- `snowflake_grant_privileges_to_database_role` (all object types that can be specified in `on_schema_object` block)

To support the missing object types:
- `DBT PROJECT`
- `JOIN POLICY`
- `PRIVACY POLICY`
- `SEMANTIC VIEW`
- `SNAPSHOT POLICY`
- `SNAPSHOT SET`

No changes in configuration and state are required.

References: [#3860](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/3860)

### Changed handling of unset `generation` and `resource_constraint` fields in the `warehouse` resource

Previously, due to limitations in Snowflake, when one of `generation` or `resource_constraint` field was unset in the configuration, the provider used `SET RESOURCE_CONSTRAINT=STANDARD_GEN_1` and `SET RESOURCE_CONSTRAINT=MEMORY_16X`, respectively. Now, the `UNSET` operation is supported for this field, and it is used in the provider in handling `generation` and `resource_constraint`.

No changes in configuration and state are required.

### *(bugfix)* Dynamic tables resource handling insufficient access and missing Text column

Previously, when the `snowflake_dynamic_table` resource was created and the dynamic table's privileges were altered in a
way that the current user lost access to view [`text` metadata field](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/dynamic-tables-privileges#label-dynamic-tables-privileges-view-metadata),
the resource threw an internal error instead of handling the situation gracefully.

Now, when the user has insufficient privileges to view `text` field,
the resource will return an error to the user with a clear message.

No changes in configuration and state are required.

References: [#3931](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/3931)

### *(bugfix)* Stages safe removal when not present in Snowflake

As the `snowflake_stage` resource wasn't adjusted fully according to the changes introduced in [this change](#new-behavior-for-read-and-delete-operations-when-removing-high-hierarchy-objects),
we had to adjust its reading function to handle the case when the stage is not present in Snowflake and should safely
remove itself from the state.

Now, when the stage is not present in Snowflake, it will be removed from the state without throwing an error (only an informational warning like in other resources).

No changes in configuration and state are required.

References: [#3959](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/3959)

### *(bugfix)* Handling destruction of snowflake_object_parameter when the parameter key is REPLICABLE_WITH_FAILOVER_GROUPS

`snowflake_object_parameter` handles the resource removal by checking the default value on the parameter and setting it.
`REPLICABLE_WITH_FAILOVER_GROUPS` parameter has a default of `UNSET` in Snowflake.
This value cannot be set correctly resulting in an error similar to:

```
SQL compilation error:
  | invalid value [UNSET] for parameter 'REPLICABLE_WITH_FAILOVER_GROUPS'
```

Until the behavior is unchanged on Snowflake, we will set this value to `YES` on destruction.

No action is needed.

## v2.6.x ➞ v2.7.0

### *(new feature)* Added support for generation 2 Standard warehouses and resource constraints for Snowpark-optimized warehouses

Snowflake offers support for generation 2 standard warehouses (read [documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/warehouses-gen2)) and resource constraints for Snowpark-optimized warehouses.

The provider did not support these features in previous versions. In this version, we added two fields: generation and resource_constraint. We decided to split resource_constraint in SHOW into two fields:
- `resource_constraint` - handling a subset of possible values designated for Snowpark-optimized warehouses,
- `generation` - handling the warehouse generation-related values for Standard warehouses.
The split aligns with the current work of making the generation its own first-class property.
We can't share more details at the moment, and we will add them when the changes are released on the Snowflake side.
These fields are available as optional configurable attributes and as read-only attributes in `show_output`.

The state is upgraded automatically. You can optionally update your configurations by explicitly setting the warehouse `type`, `generation`, or `resource_constraint`.

References: [#3258](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/3258)

### *(tool)* Added a grant migration script

As we have recently published in [this section of the new roadmap entry](./ROADMAP.md#migration),
we have prepared example script that could be used with the grants' migration.
The tool turned out to be a bit different from what we announced in our [roadmap entry](./ROADMAP.md#grants-migration);
it generates the necessary Terraform resources and import statements based on the Snowflake output.
The main idea is the same though: simplify the migration from the deprecated grant resources to the new ones.
This should streamline your grants' migration process and support upgrades to newer provider versions,
as we focus on increasing adoption of GA+ releases (`>= v2.0.0`).

The script was provided to give an idea how the migration process can be automated, and, for now, is not meant to be a standalone product.
It is not officially supported, and we do not prioritize fixes for it.
Feel free to use it as a starting point and modify it to fit your specific needs.

This script is designed to be extendable and not to be limited to grant-related resources only.
It can be used for both one-time migrations from deprecated resources to the new ones, but also importing existing objects into Terraform state.
We are open to contributions to enhance its functionality.

Currently, the script supports only a few grant resources, namely:
- `snowflake_grant_privileges_to_account_role`
- `snowflake_grant_privileges_to_database_role`
- `snowflake_grant_account_role`
- `snowflake_grant_database_role`

With the following limitations:
- grants on `future` or on `all` objects are not supported
- `all_privileges` and `always_apply` fields are not supported

You can find the script and its documentation in our [repository](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/tree/main/pkg/scripts/migration_script).

References: [#2707](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/2707)

### *(bugfix)* Fixed diff suppress for sets of identifiers
A number of resources have fields, like the `after` field in `snowflake_task`, containing a set of references to other objects (their identifiers). These fields run a custom function to correctly suppress diffs for quoting, and case. Before, when the set in state was `null`, this function could panic.

For example, in the following configuration:
```terraform
resource "snowflake_task" "parent" {
  database      = "DB"
  schema        = "PUBLIC"
  warehouse     = "SNOWFLAKE"
  name          = "TERRAFORM_PARENT_TASK"
  sql_statement = "select 1"
  started       = false
  schedule {
    using_cron = "0 9 * * * UTC"
  }
}

resource "snowflake_task" "child" {
  database      = "DB"
  schema        = "PUBLIC"
  warehouse     = "SNOWFLAKE"
  name          = "TERRAFORM_CHILD_TASK"
  sql_statement = "select 1"
  started       = false

  #   after = [snowflake_task.parent.fully_qualified_name] #<-------------------------- this is commented
}
```
After uncommenting the `after` field in the child resource and running `terraform plan -refresh=false`, the provider panicked with the following message:
```
Planning failed. Terraform encountered an error while generating this plan.
╷
│ Error: Plugin did not respond
│

<...>
```
This was not happening when `refresh` was set to true or was not set at all. This behavior may have appeared in other resources with sets of identifiers.

Now, this behavior is fixed, and the provider will not panic. No changes in configuration and state are required.

### *(bugfix)* Fixed privileges validation in `grant_privileges_to_account_role` resource
In [v2.6.0](#bugfix-fixed-privileges-validation-in-grant_privileges_to_account_role-resource), we added a validation for using the `IMPORTED PRIVILEGES` grant. The validator contained a bug, causing the provider to panic in situations with privileges set by a reference, like this one:
```terraform
resource "snowflake_grant_privileges_to_account_role" "direct" {
  account_role_name = "ROLE"
  privileges        = [var.privilege]

  on_account_object {
    object_type = "DATABASE"
    object_name = "DB"
  }

}

variable "privilege" {
  type = string
  default = "USAGE"
}
```

The provider panicked with the following message:
```
│ Error: Plugin did not respond
│
│ The plugin encountered an error, and failed to respond to the plugin6.(*GRPCProvider).ValidateResourceConfig call. The plugin logs may contain more details.
╵

Stack trace from the terraform-provider-snowflake_v2.6.0 plugin:

panic: value is unknown

goroutine 23 [running]:
github.com/hashicorp/go-cty/cty.Value.AsString({{{0x1029376c8?, 0x14000011051?}}, {0x1025b2060?, 0x103b04ec0?}})
        github.com/hashicorp/go-cty@v1.5.0/cty/value_ops.go:1187 +0x100
<...>
```

Now, this behavior is fixed, and the provider will not panic. No changes in configuration and state are required.

## v2.5.0 ➞ v2.6.0

### *(improvement)* Handling conversion-based errors

Previously, when an error occurred during the conversion from Snowflake data to the SDK object, the error would be printed as a debug log.
We would then proceed with the conversion and later handle the standard operations within the resource or data source with potentially incorrectly converted data.

This could result in errors at the resource or data source level, sometimes causing undefined behavior.
Ideally, these errors should be detected and addressed at the conversion level.

Let's say we got an error in one of our conversion functions that transfers a text column containing JSON to a Go structure.
Before the change, on failure, we would print something similar to:
```text
[DEBUG] Failed to convert X, err: <error from JSON mapping>
```

After implementing these improvements, any such failure will be propagated and acknowledged by the resources and data sources.
This will result in operations reporting failures, as in the following example:
```text
conversion from Snowflake failed with error: failed to convert X, err: <error from JSON mapping>
```

If you encounter any errors of this kind, we encourage you to report them. Your feedback helps us improve the provider stability.

### *(bugfix)* Fixed handling `IMPORTED PRIVILEGES` grant in the `grant_privileges_to_account_role` resource
In Snowflake, `WITH GRANT OPTION` is not supported when granting or revoking the `IMPORTED PRIVILEGES` privilege. In previous versions, in handling resource updates, the provider revoked `IMPORTED PRIVILEGES` with `WITH GRANT OPTION`, even for cases when this option was not set in the resource. It resulted in errors like
```
│ Error: Failed to revoke privileges to add
│
│   with module.roles.module.roles["data_engineer"].module.databases.snowflake_grant_privileges_to_account_role.grant["snowflake"],
│   on ../../modules/role/privileges/account/database/main.tf line 32, in resource "snowflake_grant_privileges_to_account_role" "grant":
│   32: resource "snowflake_grant_privileges_to_account_role" "grant" {
│
│ Id: "DATA_ENGINEER"|false|false|IMPORTED
│ PRIVILEGES|OnAccountObject|DATABASE|"SNOWFLAKE"
│ Privileges to add: [IMPORTED PRIVILEGES]
│ Error: 001003 (42000): SQL compilation error:
│ syntax error line 1 at position 24 unexpected 'IMPORTED'.
```
This behavior has been fixed. No state or configuration update is necessary.

Additionally, when `IMPORTED PRIVILEGES` is granted with other privileges in one resource, the provider now validates that and fails with the following error:
```
  | exit status 1
  |
  | Error: Invalid privileges
  |
  |   with snowflake_grant_privileges_to_account_role.test,
  |   on terraform_plugin_test.tf line 12, in resource "snowflake_grant_privileges_to_account_role" "test":
  |   12: resource "snowflake_grant_privileges_to_account_role" "test" {
  |
  | IMPORTED PRIVILEGES cannot be used with other privileges
```
Before, this was not validated, but it failed in Snowflake.

### *(bugfix)* Fixed `snowflake_primary_connection` or `snowflake_secondary_connection` reading and improved creation and deletion operations

When configuring `snowflake_primary_connection` or `snowflake_secondary_connection` resources, previous issues could lead to failures or incorrect planning.
These problems arose because the shared connections appear in the `SHOW CONNECTIONS` command, and because Snowflake requires primary and secondary connections to have the same name,
they were not distinguished correctly; the first appearing one was chosen. We have now resolved this by fixing the function that retrieves the connection by ID, ensuring such issues do not occur.

Additionally, we have made adjustments to the create operation for `snowflake_secondary_connection` and the delete operations for both `snowflake_primary_connection` and `snowflake_secondary_connection`.
These adjustments aim to prevent issues that could arise from Snowflake systems registering or unregistering connections asynchronously to the create/delete operations.
However, these issues may still occur depending on system latencies. If you encounter errors from the provider when creating or deleting both in the same `terraform apply`, please report them.

We generally recommend splitting the creation and deletion of both resources into two steps to allow Snowflake's background systems sufficient time to process these operations efficiently.

## v2.4.x ➞ v2.5.0

### *(bugfix)* Fixed incorrect authenticator when using the `token` field

> [!TIP]
> This change introduced a regression: after the fix, when the TOML profile is empty, the `authenticator` is not set to `OAUTH` when it is not in the Terraform configuration (the default `SNOWFLAKE` is used instead). This could result in errors like `Error: 260002: password is empty`. As a workaround, you can manually set the `authenticator` field in the provider configuration to `OAUTH`. This bug is fixed in [v2.9.0](#v28x--v290).

Previously, the provider incorrectly set the default authenticator to `OAUTH` when the `token` field was specified in the Terraform configuration, or environmental variables, without possibility to override it. This resulted in errors like:
```
Planning failed. Terraform encountered an error while generating this plan.

╷
│ Error: open snowflake connection: 390303 (08004): Invalid OAuth access token. [fca49dca-38da-421e-b88e-94547d09b3cf]
│
│   with provider["registry.terraform.io/snowflakedb/snowflake"],
│   on main.tf line 9, in provider "snowflake":
│    9: provider "snowflake" {
│
╵
```

Now, the default authenticator can be overridden. For example, for the PAT authenticator, set one of the following:
- `authenticator="PROGRAMMATIC_ACCESS_TOKEN"` in your Terraform configuration, or
- `SNOWFLAKE_AUTHENTICATOR="PROGRAMMATIC_ACCESS_TOKEN"` in your environmental variables, or
- `authenticator='PROGRAMMATIC_ACCESS_TOKEN'` in your TOML configuration file.

### *(bugfix)* Fixed `default_ddl_collation` for `snowflake_schema` resource

Previously, the `default_ddl_collation` field in the `snowflake_schema` resource was not able to correctly handle setting an empty string as a proper value.
This is mostly connected to both things: [Terraform empty value handling](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/v1-preparations/CHANGES_BEFORE_V1.md#empty-values) and our [internal parameter handling](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/v1-preparations/CHANGES_BEFORE_V1.md#snowflake-parameters).
With the provided fix, we were able to make it work, however, it is not a perfect solution as it requires an intermediate step.
To set the `default_ddl_collation` to an empty string from non-empty value, you need to:
- Set it to `null` (or remove it from the resource configuration) and run `terraform apply` to remove the value from the state
- Then set it to an empty string and run `terraform apply` again to set the value to an empty string in Snowflake on the schema level.

As we already confirmed, this shouldn't be a problem in the future, once we move our provider to the new Terraform Plugin Framework, but for now, this is the best solution we can provide.
We will be checking other resources that may have similar issues and will fix them in the future releases.
No configuration changes are needed, but if you want to set the `default_ddl_collation` to an empty string, please follow the steps above.

### *(bugfix)* Fixed granting other table types in `snowflake_grant_privileges_to_share` resource

Previously, the `snowflake_grant_privileges_to_share` resource was not able to grant privileges on other table types than `TABLE`.
For example, granting on hybrid table wouldn't work as it has different type than `TABLE` returned by SHOW GRANTS in Snowflake.
With the help of the community ([PR reference](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/pull/3859)), we are able to provide the fix this issue.
Now, the configurations like the following will work as expected:

```terraform
resource "snowflake_grant_privileges_to_share" "test" {
  to_share   = "<share_name>"
  privileges = ["<privilege>"]
  on_table   = "<hybrid_table_name>"
}
```

No changes to the current configurations are needed.

References: [#3167](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/3167)

### *(new feature)* snowflake_listing resource
Added a new preview resource for managing listings. Check the official Snowflake documentation to know more [about listings](https://other-docs.snowflake.com/en/collaboration/collaboration-listings-about). You can read about the resource limitations in the documentation in the registry.

> **Warning** This resource isn't suitable for public listings because its review process doesn't align with Terraform's standard method for managing infrastructure resources. The challenge is that the review process often takes time and might need several manual revisions. We need to reconsider how to integrate this process into a resource. Although we plan to support this in the future, it might be added later. Currently, the resource may not function well with public listings because review requests are closely connected to the publish field.

> **Note** For inlined manifest version, only string is accepted. The manifest structure is not mapped to the resource schema to keep it simple and aligned with other resources that accept similar metadata (e.g., service templates). While it's more recommended to keep your manifest in a stage, the inlined version may be useful for initial setup and testing.

This feature will be marked as a stable feature in future releases. Breaking changes are expected, even without bumping the major version. To use this feature, add `snowflake_listing_resource` to `preview_features_enabled` field in the provider configuration.

### *(new feature)* Added `storage_aws_external_id` field in the `storage_integration` resource

Previously, this field was read-only. In this version, this field is promoted to optional configurable attribute. Because config was previously empty, and there is a value in state, the provider will show the planned change to `null`. After applying, the plan should be empty. This apply is effectively a no-op, as it will run ALTER UNSET on the integration, which will revert the `storage_aws_external_id` to the default (the same value as there was no option to set it through the resource before). In case, when the value was changed externally (manually or through `snowflake_execute`), make sure to set this value in config before bumping the version.

If `storage_aws_external_id` was used as input in other fields, it needs to be changed because of the SDKv2 limitations (read more [here](./v1-preparations/CHANGES_BEFORE_V1.md#config-values-in-the-state) and [here](./v1-preparations/CHANGES_BEFORE_V1.md#raw-snowflake-output)). To reference it in other blocks:
- set its value directly in the resource OR
- use `snowflake_storage_integration.<resource_name>.describe_output.0.storage_aws_external_id.0.value` instead.

We added a new `describe_output` field to handle this field properly (read more in our [design considerations](v1-preparations/CHANGES_BEFORE_V1.md#default-values)). Note that fields other than `storage_aws_external_id` do not leverage this field. This will be addressed during the resource rework.

Note that this resource is still in preview, and not officially supported. This change was requested and done by the community: [#3659](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/pull/3659).

References: [#3924](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/3924)

### *(bugfix)* Fix setting network policies with lowercase characters in security integrations
Previously, when the provider created or set a security integration (in `snowflake_oauth_integration_for_custom_clients` or `snowflake_scim_integration`) with a network policy containing lowercase letters, this could fail due to a different quoting used in Snowflake in these objects. Namely, despite using the `"` quotes, the referenced network name was uppercased in Snowflake. This means that the uppercased network policy was used instead.
Snowflake could return errors like `Network policy TEST does not exist or not authorized.`.
In this case, a special quoting needs to be used (see [docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-security-integration-oauth-snowflake)). Instead of the usual `NETWORK_POLICY = "test"`, it needs to be `NETWORK_POLICY = '"test"'`.

In this version, this behavior is fixed. The provider always uses the mixed `'"name"'` notation, and the casing should match the name in Snowflake.

References: [#3229](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/3229)

## v2.3.0 ➞ v2.4.0

### *(new feature)* snowflake_current_organization_account resource
Added a new preview resource for managing the organization account that the provider is currently connected to. It's capable of managing attached parameters, resource_monitors, and more. See reference docs for [ALTERING ORGANIZATION ACCOUNT](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/alter-organization-account). You can read about the resource limitations in the documentation in the registry.

This feature will be marked as a stable feature in future releases. Breaking changes are expected, even without bumping the major version. To use this feature, add `snowflake_current_organization_account_resource` to `preview_features_enabled` field in the provider configuration.

### *(new feature)* Handling Programmatic Access Tokens
As we announced in our [roadmap](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/ROADMAP.md#pat-support), we implemented handling Programmatic Access Tokens (PATs) in the provider. In [v2.3.0](#v220--v230), we already added `PROGRAMMATIC_ACCESS_TOKEN` authenticator option.
In this version, we enhanced the provider capabilities with handling PATs in a new resource and data source. See more in our [Authentication Methods guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/2.4.0/docs/guides/authentication_methods#pat-personal-access-token).

#### New `snowflake_user_programmatic_access_tokens` data source
Added a new preview data source for user programmatic access tokens. See reference [docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/show-user-programmatic-access-tokens).

This feature will be marked as a stable feature in future releases. Breaking changes are expected, even without bumping the major version. To use this feature, add `snowflake_user_programmatic_access_tokens_datasource` to `preview_features_enabled` field in the provider configuration.

#### New `snowflake_user_programmatic_access_token` resource
Added a new preview resource for managing users' programmatic access tokens. See reference [docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/alter-user-add-programmatic-access-token) and a [user guide](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/programmatic-access-tokens) for more details.

This resource also supports token rotation. See our [Authentication Methods guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/2.4.0/docs/guides/authentication_methods#managing-pats) and the [resource documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/2.4.0/docs/resources/user_programmatic_access_token).

This feature will be marked as a stable feature in future releases. Breaking changes are expected, even without bumping the major version. To use this feature, add `snowflake_user_programmatic_access_token_resource` to `preview_features_enabled` field in the provider configuration.

## v2.2.0 ➞ v2.3.0

### *(new feature)* New `PROGRAMMATIC_ACCESS_TOKEN` authenticator option

We added a new `PROGRAMMATIC_ACCESS_TOKEN` option to the `authenticator` field in the provider. This feature enables authentication with `PROGRAMMATIC_ACCESS_TOKEN` authenticator in the Go driver. Read more in our [Authentication methods](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/guides/authentication_methods) guide.

See [Snowflake official documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/programmatic-access-tokens) for more information on PAT authentication.

### *(bugfix)* Fix `snowflake_functions` and `snowflake_procedures` data sources with 2025_03 Bundle enabled

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This behavior change in Snowflake was originally in the [2025_03 Bundle](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/bcr-bundles/2025_03_bundle) and intended to become enabled by default in the 2025_04 bundle. However, it has been [postponed](https://docs.snowflake.com/release-notes/bcr-bundles/un-bundled/bcr-1944) and a new release date has not been determined.
> After adjusting parsing data types in the provider, it handles arguments with and without attributes.

Check for more details and action steps needed in [Argument output changes for SHOW FUNCTIONS and SHOW PROCEDURES commands](./SNOWFLAKE_BCR_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md#argument-output-changes-for-show-functions-and-show-procedures-commands).
This fix was also backported to version v1.2.3.

## v2.1.x ➞ v2.2.0
<a id="v210--v220"></a>

### *(breaking change, new feature)* Changes in `snowflake_tables` data source

We adjusted the `snowflake_tables` data source with the following:
- Moved the `database` and `schema` fields to the `in` block (breaking change). See the before/after examples below.
- Added support for `IN APPLICATION`, `IN APPLICATION PACKAGE`, `LIKE`, `STARTS WITH`, and `LIMIT`.
- Added support for getting data with `DESCRIBE TABLE` - see the `with_describe` field.
- Changed the output format returned by the data source (breaking change). See the before/after examples below.

With added support for `IN APPLICATION` and `IN APPLICATION PACKAGE` filters, we also nested the `database` and `schema` fields in a separate `in` block and made all these fields optional. For example, please adjust the configurations from:
```terraform
data "snowflake_tables" "current" {
  database = "MYDB"
}
```
to
```terraform
data "snowflake_tables" "current" {
  in {
    database = "MYDB"
  }
}
```

The output format is also changed. Now, all data is nested in `tables.show_output`, and in `tables.describe_output` if `with_describe` is set to `true`.

Before:

```terraform
output "simple_output" {
  value = data.snowflake_tables.test.tables[0].name
}
```
After:

```
output "simple_output" {
  value = data.snowflake_tables.test.tables[0].show_output[0].name
}

output "describe_output" {
  value = data.snowflake_tables.test.tables[0].describe_output[0].name # Column name from the DESCRIBE TABLE query.
}
```

Please read the [documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/2.2.0/docs/data-sources/tables) for more information.

Note that `snowflake_tables` data source and `snowflake_table` resource are still in preview.

### *(bugfix)* Fix `ENABLE_INTERNAL_STAGES_PRIVATELINK` mapping in `snowflake_account_parameter` resource

Due to incorrect mapping in setting account parameter logic in [`snowflake_account_parameter`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/2.1.0/docs/resources/account_parameter), the [`ENABLE_INTERNAL_STAGES_PRIVATELINK`](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/parameters#enable-internal-stages-privatelink) could not be set. Setting it results in setting the [`ALLOW_ID_TOKEN`](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/parameters#allow-id-token) parameter instead. This version introduces the corrected mapping.

No configuration changes are needed. However, the provider won't set back the `ALLOW_ID_TOKEN` parameter value as we can't detect if setting its value was intentional (manually or through `snowflake_account_parameter`). Because of that, please verify your `ALLOW_ID_TOKEN` parameter and set it to the desired value.

This fix was also backported to versions v1.0.6, v1.1.1, v1.2.2, v2.0.1, and v2.1.1.

### *(bugfix)* Fix grant_ownership resource for serverless tasks

Previously, it wasn't possible to use the `snowflake_grant_ownership` resource to grant ownership of serverless tasks.
In this version, we fixed the issue, and now you can use the resource to grant ownership of serverless tasks.

No configuration changes are needed.

References: [#3750](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/3750)

### *(bugfix)* Fix external volume creation error handling

Errors in [`snowflake_external_volume`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/2.1.0/docs/resources/external_volume) resource creation were not handled and propagated properly, resulting in provider errors similar to:
```
Warning: Failed to query external volume. Marking the resource as removed.
│
│   with snowflake_external_volume.s3_volume,
│   on main.tf line 62, in resource "snowflake_external_volume" "s3_volume":
│   62: resource "snowflake_external_volume" "s3_volume" {
│
│ External Volume: "MY_S3_EXTERNAL_VOLUME", Err: object does not exist
╵
╷
│ Error: Provider produced inconsistent result after apply
│
│ When applying changes to snowflake_external_volume.s3_volume, provider
│ "provider[\"registry.terraform.io/snowflakedb/snowflake\"]" produced an unexpected new value: Root object
│ was present, but now absent.
│
│ This is a bug in the provider, which should be reported in the provider's own issue tracker.
```

Starting with this version, creation errors in `snowflake_external_volume` will be handled and propagated properly to the user.

No configuration changes are needed.

### *(new feature)* New fields in snowflake_cortex_search_service resource

We added a new `embedding_model` field to the `snowflake_cortex_search_service`. This field specifies the embedding model to use in the Cortex Search Service.
We updated the examples of using the resource with this field.
Additionally, we added a new `describe_output` field to handle this field properly (read more in our [design considerations](v1-preparations/CHANGES_BEFORE_V1.md#default-values)).

### *(new feature)* New consumption_billing_entity field in snowflake_account resource

The `snowflake_account` resource now has a new `consumption_billing_entity` field, which allows you to set the consumption billing entity for the account.
It is useful in case you have multiple billing entities in your account and want to set a specific one for the account.
You can find more details in [this](https://community.snowflake.com/s/article/ERROR-Multiple-suitable-billing-entities-exist-for-the-target-cloud) KB article.

No configuration changes are needed.

### The ORGADMIN checks removed from snowflake_account resource

Previously, the `snowflake_account` resource required the ORGADMIN role for operations to be executed.
In recent Snowflake changes that introduced organization accounts, more roles can now manage the account.
Because of that, to enable the resource to be used in more scenarios, we removed the ORGADMIN checks from the resource.

### *(new feature)* New tracking level

Every resource that is capable of setting tracing level (`database`, `shared_database`, `secondary_database`, `schema`) now supports the new `PROPAGATE` value.

### *(bugfix)* Fix how snowflake_user_authentication_policy_attachment resource handles missing objects it depends on

Previously, the `snowflake_user_authentication_policy_attachment` resource was not able to handle missing objects it depends on.
This means, if a user or authentication policy was removed manually outside Terraform, the provider would produce plans with errors like:
```
User 'XYZ' does not exist or not authorized
```
and only manual state management would help you to remove the resource from the state.

Now, the removal of the resource is handled properly and the resource is removed from the state automatically with the following warning:
```
Failed to find user authentication policy. Marking the resource as removed.
### or ###
Failed to get user policies. Marking the resource as removed.
```

If you are encountering this issue,
either bump the provider version to at least `v2.2.0` or [remove the resource from the state manually](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/state/rm).

No configuration changes are needed.

References: [#3672](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/3672)

### *(new feature)* snowflake_current_account resource
Added a new preview resource for managing an account that the provider is currently connected to. It's capable of managing attached parameters, resource_monitors, and more. See reference docs for [ALTERING ACCOUNT](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/alter-account). You can read about the resources' limitations in the documentation in the registry.
This resource is intended to replace the `snowflake_account_parameter` resource, which will be deprecated in the future,
but some of the supported parameters in `snowflake_account_parameter` aren't supported in `snowflake_current_account`. Those parameters are:
- ENABLE_CONSOLE_OUTPUT
- ENABLE_PERSONAL_DATABASE
- PREVENT_LOAD_FROM_INLINE_URL

They are not supported, because they are not in the [official parameters documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/parameters).
Once they are publicly documented, they will be added to the `snowflake_current_account_resource` resource.

The `snowflake_current_account_resource` resource shouldn't be used with `snowflake_object_parameter` (with `on_account` field set) and `snowflake_account_parameter` resources in the same configuration, as it may lead to unexpected behavior. Unless they're used to manage the above parameters that are not supported.
The resource shouldn't be also used with `snowflake_account_password_policy_attachment`, `snowflake_network_policy_attachment`, `snowflake_account_authentication_policy_attachment` resources in the same configuration to manage policies on the current account, as it may lead to unexpected behavior.

This feature will be marked as a stable feature in future releases. Breaking changes are expected, even without bumping the major version. To use this feature, add `snowflake_current_account_resource` to `preview_features_enabled` field in the provider configuration.

### *(new feature)* snowflake_service and snowflake_job_service resources
Added new preview resources for managing services and job services. See reference docs for [services](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-service) and [job services](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/execute-job-service). You can read about the resources' limitations in the documentation in the registry.

These features will be marked as stable in future releases. Breaking changes are expected, even without bumping the major version. To use these features, add `snowflake_service_resource` or `snowflake_job_service_resource` to `preview_features_enabled` field in the provider configuration, respectively.

### *(new feature)* snowflake_git_repository resource
Added a new preview resource for managing git repositories. See reference [docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-git-repository). Note that `snowflake_api_integration` currently does not support `git_https_api` type. It will be added during the resource rework. Instead, you can use [execute](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/execute) resource.

This feature will be marked as a stable feature in future releases. Breaking changes are expected, even without bumping the major version. To use this feature, add `snowflake_git_repository_resource` to `preview_features_enabled` field in the provider configuration.

### *(new feature)* snowflake_compute_pool resource
Added a new preview resource for managing compute pools. See reference [docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-compute-pool). The limitation of this resource is that identifiers with special or lower-case characters are not supported. This limitation in the provider follows the limitation in Snowflake (see the linked docs).

Managing compute pool state is limited. It is handled only by `initially_suspended`, `auto_suspend_secs`, and `auto_resume` fields. See the resource documentation for more details.

This feature will be marked as a stable feature in future releases. Breaking changes are expected, even without bumping the major version. To use this feature, add `snowflake_compute_pool_resource` to `preview_features_enabled` field in the provider configuration.

### *(bugfix)* Fix the behavior for empty privileges list in snowflake_grant_privileges_to_account_role, snowflake_grant_privileges_to_database_role, and snowflake_grant_privileges_to_share resources

Previously, it was possible to create `snowflake_grant_privileges_to_X` resources with an empty privilege list, which led to the following error:
```
│ Error: Failed to parse internal identifier
│ Error: [grant_privileges_to_database_role_identifier.go:79] invalid Privileges value: , should be either a comma separated list of privileges or "ALL" / "ALL PRIVILEGES" for all privileges
```
After that, an identifier stored in state would be corrupted and only manual state manipulation would fix it.
We added validation to prevent this from happening. Now, if you try to create or update a resource with an empty privilege list, you will get the following error:

```
| Error: Not enough list items
|
|   with snowflake_grant_privileges_to_database_role.test,
|   on test.tf line 3, in resource "snowflake_grant_privileges_to_database_role" "test":
|    3:   privileges         = []
|
| Attribute privileges requires 1 item minimum, but config has only 0 declared.
```

and the validation error will prevent the state file from changing, which means you will be able to normally adjust the resource and reapply the configuration.

If you are experiencing this at the moment, you can fix it by running removing `snowflake_grant_privileges_to_database_role` from the state by running:
```shell
terraform state rm snowflake_grant_privileges_to_database_role.test # Replace `test` with the actual resource name
```
and apply it with the correct `privileges` list. If you don't want to apply the privileges again, make sure they are
revoked in Snowflake by running the corresponding [SHOW GRANTS](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/show-grants) command
and then corresponding [REVOKE <privileges>](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/revoke-privilege) to remove unwanted privileges.

Other than that, no changes to the configurations are necessary.

### *(new feature)* snowflake_image_repository resource
Added a new preview resource for managing image repositories. See reference [docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-image-repository). The limitation of this resource is that quoted names for special characters or case-sensitive names are not supported. Please use only characters compatible with [unquoted identifiers](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/identifiers-syntax#label-unquoted-identifier). The same constraint also applies to database and schema names where you create an image repository. This limitation in the provider follows the limitation in Snowflake (see the linked docs).

This feature will be marked as a stable feature in future releases. Breaking changes are expected, even without bumping the major version. To use this feature, add `snowflake_image_repository_resource` to `preview_features_enabled` field in the provider configuration.

### *(new feature)* snowflake_git_repositories data source
Added a new preview data source for git repositories. See reference [docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/show-git-repositories).

This feature will be marked as a stable feature in future releases. Breaking changes are expected, even without bumping the major version. To use this feature, add `snowflake_git_repositories_datasource` to `preview_features_enabled` field in the provider configuration.

### *(new feature)* snowflake_compute_pools data source
Added a new preview data source for compute pools. See reference [docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/show-compute-pools).

This feature will be marked as a stable feature in future releases. Breaking changes are expected, even without bumping the major version. To use this feature, add `snowflake_compute_pools_datasource` to `preview_features_enabled` field in the provider configuration.

### *(new feature)* snowflake_image_repositories data source
Added a new preview data source for image repositories. See reference [docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/show-image-repositories).

This feature will be marked as a stable feature in future releases. Breaking changes are expected, even without bumping the major version. To use this feature, add `snowflake_image_repositories_datasource` to `preview_features_enabled` field in the provider configuration.

### *(new feature)* snowflake_services data source
Added a new preview data source for services. See reference [docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/show-services).

This feature will be marked as a stable feature in future releases. Breaking changes are expected, even without bumping the major version. To use this feature, add `snowflake_services_datasource` to `preview_features_enabled` field in the provider configuration.

### *(new feature)* Managing tags for image repositories, compute pools, services, and git repositories
The [snowflake_tag_association](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/tag_association) can now be used for managing tags in [image repositories](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-image-repository), [compute pools](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-compute-pool), [services](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-service) and [git repositories](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-git-repository).

### *(bugfix)* Fixed handling users' grants

In v2.1.0, we introduced a fix in handling users' grants ([migration guide](#bugfix-fixed-snowflake_grant_database_role-resource)), which addressed changes in the `2025_02` bundle. The username was parsed incorrectly if it had a prefix formed of `U`, `S`, `E`, and `R` characters. The username returned from `SHOW GRANTS` was incorrect in this case. Now, such names should be handled correctly.
No configuration changes are necessary.

### *(new feature)* Granting privileges on future cortex search services

As this is now available on Snowflake, we allow to grant privileges on future cortex search services both in `snowflake_grant_privileges_on_account_role` and `snowflake_grant_privileges_on_database_role`.

## v2.1.0 ➞ v2.1.1
<a id="v210---v211"></a>

### *(bugfix)* Fix `ENABLE_INTERNAL_STAGES_PRIVATELINK` mapping in `snowflake_account_parameter` resource

Due to incorrect mapping in setting account parameter logic in [`snowflake_account_parameter`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/2.1.0/docs/resources/account_parameter), the [`ENABLE_INTERNAL_STAGES_PRIVATELINK`](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/parameters#enable-internal-stages-privatelink) could not be set. Setting it results in setting the [`ALLOW_ID_TOKEN`](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/parameters#allow-id-token) parameter instead. This version introduces the corrected mapping.

No configuration changes are needed. However, the provider won't set back the `ALLOW_ID_TOKEN` parameter value as we can't detect if setting its value was intentional (manually or through `snowflake_account_parameter`). Because of that, please verify your `ALLOW_ID_TOKEN` parameter and set it to the desired value.

This fix was also backported to versions v1.0.6, v1.1.1, v1.2.2, and v2.0.1.

## v2.0.x ➞ v2.1.0
<a id="v200--v210"></a>

### *(bugfix)* Fixed `snowflake_tag_association` resource

The `snowflake_tag_association` resource was crashing when performing the update operation (e.g., because the `tag_value` was changed)
for objects that are created on schema level. This was fixed, and now you can create tag associations for objects that are created on schema level.

Reference: [#3622](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/3622).

### *(bugfix)* Added missing `DISABLE_USER_PRIVILEGE_GRANTS` account parameter

As part of the [2025_02 Bundle](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/bcr-bundles/2025_02_bundle), support for User Based Access Control (UBAC) will be added ([BCR-1924](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/bcr-bundles/2025_02/bcr-1924)).
It can be disabled by setting the `DISABLE_USER_PRIVILEGE_GRANTS` parameter to `true`.
This version adds the support for this parameter in the `snowflake_account_parameter` resource.

Reference: [#3639](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/3639).

### *(bugfix)* Imports propagation to Snowflake for all `snowflake_procedure_*` resources

The `snowflake_procedure_python`, `snowflake_procedure_scala`, and `snowflake_procedure_java` resources were not propagating changes to `imports` set to Snowflake.
There is no `ALTER` to update the imports post-creation, so changes require dropping and recreating the given procedure.

No action is needed.

Reference: [#3401](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/3401).

### *(bugfix)* Fixed permadiff issue with the `network_policy` attribute in all user resources

Using `snowflake_network_policy.my_policy.fully_qualified_name` directly as `network_policy` input for `snowflake_user`, `snowflake_service_user`, and `snowflake_legacy_service_user` resources could result in a permadiff (like ` ~ network_policy = "NETWORK_POLICY_ID" -> "\"NETWORK_POLICY_ID\""`).
This version adds appropriate validation and diff suppression to `network_policy` attribute, so such permadiffs are avoided.

No action is needed.

Reference: [#3655](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/3655).

### *(bugfix)* Fixed snowflake_grant_database_role resource

The `2025_02` Snowflake BCR enables granting database roles directly to users.
This caused issues in the provider, leading to `Provider produced inconsistent result after apply` errors
when a database role was granted to a user. This version resolves the issue.
No configuration changes are necessary.

### *(bugfix)* Fix `ENABLE_INTERNAL_STAGES_PRIVATELINK` mapping in `snowflake_account_parameter` resource

Due to incorrect mapping in setting account parameter logic in [`snowflake_account_parameter`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/2.1.0/docs/resources/account_parameter), the [`ENABLE_INTERNAL_STAGES_PRIVATELINK`](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/parameters#enable-internal-stages-privatelink) could not be set. Setting it results in setting the [`ALLOW_ID_TOKEN`](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/parameters#allow-id-token) parameter instead. This version introduces the corrected mapping.

No configuration changes are needed. However, the provider won't set back the `ALLOW_ID_TOKEN` parameter value as we can't detect if setting its value was intentional (manually or through `snowflake_account_parameter`). Because of that, please verify your `ALLOW_ID_TOKEN` parameter and set it to the desired value.

### Supported architectures

We have compiled a list to clarify which binaries are officially supported and which are provided additionally but not officially supported.
The lists are based on what the underlying [gosnowflake driver](https://github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake) supports and what [HashiCorp recommends for Terraform providers](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/registry/providers/os-arch).

The provider officially supports the binaries built for the following OSes and architectures:
- Windows: amd64
- Linux: amd64 and arm64
- Darwin: amd64 and arm64

Currently, we also provide the binaries for the following OSes and architectures, but they are not officially supported, and we do not prioritize fixes for them:
- Windows: arm64 and 386
- Linux: 386
- Darwin: 386
- Freebsd: any architecture

### *(breaking change)* Changes in sensitive values
To ensure better security of users' data, we adjusted the fields containing sensitive information to be sensitive in the provider.
Some fields had to be removed due to Terraform SDK limitations (more on that in the [removal of sensitive fields](#removal-of-sensitive-fields) section).
This means these values will not be printed by Terraform during planning, etc. Note that the users are still responsible for storing the state securely.
Read more about sensitive values in the [Terraform documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/configuration-language/sensitive-variables).

Fields changed to sensitive:
- provider configuration: `passcode` field
- `snowflake_system_generate_scim_access_token` data source: `access_token` field
- `snowflake_api_authentication_integration_with_authorization_code_grant` resource: `oauth_client_id` and `oauth_client_secret` fields,
- `snowflake_api_authentication_integration_with_client_credentials` resource: `oauth_client_id` and `oauth_client_secret` fields,
- `snowflake_api_authentication_integration_with_jwt_bearer` resource: `oauth_client_id` and `oauth_client_secret` fields,
- `snowflake_saml2_integration` resource: `saml2_x509_cert` field
- `snowflake_storage_integration` resource: `azure_consent_url` field

If you reference one of these fields in an output or a variable block, then it needs to be marked as `sensitive = true` in the Terraform configuration. Read [Output documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/outputs#sensitive-suppressing-values-in-cli-output) and [Variable documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/variables#suppressing-values-in-cli-output) for more details. In other case, you will get an error like this:
```
Planning failed. Terraform encountered an error while generating this plan.

╷
│ Error: Output refers to sensitive values
│
│   on 3565.tf line 84:
│   84: output "sensitive_output" {
│
│ To reduce the risk of accidentally exporting sensitive data that was intended to be only internal, Terraform requires that any root module output containing sensitive data be explicitly marked
│ as sensitive, to confirm your intent.
│
│ If you do intend to export this data, annotate the output value as sensitive by adding the following argument:
│     sensitive = true
╵
```

Some fields, like secure function definitions, can also contain sensitive values. However, because of [SDK v2](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2) limitations:
- There is no possibility to mark sensitive values conditionally ([reference](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/issues/736)). This means it is not possible to mark sensitive values based on other fields, like marking `body` based on the value of `secure` field in views, functions, and procedures. As a result, this field is not marked as sensitive. For such cases, we add disclaimers in the resource documentation.
- There is no possibility to mark sensitive values in nested fields ([reference](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/issues/201)). This means the nested fields, like these in `show_output` and `describe_output` cannot be marked as sensitive.

Instead, we added notes in the documentation of the related resources. The full list includes:
- `snowflake_execute` resource: `execute`, `revert`, `query` and `query_results` fields,
- `snowflake_external_function` resource: `context_headers` and `header` fields,
- `snowflake_function_java` resource: `function_definition` and `show_output.arguments_raw` fields,
- `snowflake_function_javascript` resource: `function_definition` and `show_output.arguments_raw` fields,
- `snowflake_function_python` resource: `function_definition` and `show_output.arguments_raw` fields,
- `snowflake_function_scala` resource: `function_definition` and `show_output.arguments_raw` fields,
- `snowflake_function_sql` resource: `function_definition` and `show_output.arguments_raw` fields,
- `snowflake_legacy_service_user` resource: `display_name`, `show_output.display_name`, `show_output.email`, `show_output.login_name`, `show_output.first_name` and `show_output.last_name` fields,
- `snowflake_masking_policy` resource: `body` and `describe_output.body` fields,
- `snowflake_masking_policies` data source: `describe_output.body` field,
- `snowflake_materialized_view` resource: `statement` field,
- `snowflake_oauth_integration_for_custom_clients` resource: `oauth_redirect_uri` and `describe_output.oauth_redirect_uri` fields,
- `snowflake_oauth_integration_for_partner_applications` resource: `oauth_redirect_uri` and `describe_output.oauth_redirect_uri` fields,
- `snowflake_materialized_view` resource: `statement` field,
- `snowflake_procedure_java` resource: `procedure_definition` and `show_output.arguments_raw` fields,
- `snowflake_procedure_javascript` resource: `procedure_definition` and `show_output.arguments_raw` fields,
- `snowflake_procedure_python` resource: `procedure_definition` and `show_output.arguments_raw` fields,
- `snowflake_procedure_scala` resource: `procedure_definition` and `show_output.arguments_raw` fields,
- `snowflake_procedure_sql` resource: `procedure_definition` and `show_output.arguments_raw` fields,
- `snowflake_row_access_policy` resource: `body` and `describe_output.body` fields,
- `snowflake_row_access_policies` data source: `describe_output.body` field,
- `snowflake_security_integrations` data source: `describe_output.redirect_uri` field,
- `snowflake_service_user` resource: `display_name`, `show_output.display_name`, `show_output.email`, `show_output.login_name`, `show_output.first_name`, `show_output.middle_name` and `show_output.last_name` fields,
- `snowflake_task` resource: `config`, `show_output.config` and `show_output.definition` fields,
- `snowflake_tasks` data source: `show_output.config` and `show_output.definition` fields,
- `snowflake_user` resource: `display_name`, `show_output.display_name`, `show_output.email`, `show_output.login_name`, `show_output.first_name`, `show_output.middle_name` and `show_output.last_name` fields,
- `snowflake_users` data source: `display_name`, `email`, `login_name`, `first_name`, `middle_name` and `last_name` fields nested in `show_output` and `describe_output`,
- `snowflake_view` resource: `statement` and `show_output.text` fields,
- `snowflake_views` data source: `show_output.text` field,

#### Removal of sensitive fields

The following table represents fields removed from resources. They were removed because of the Terraform SDK limitations
on marking data as sensitive in objects or collections ([Terraform issue reference](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/28222)). Removal of computed output fields may have an impact on detecting
external changes (on the Snowflake side) for (usually) top-level fields they were referring to (e.g. `describe_output.oauth_client_id` -> `oauth_client_id`).

> Note: We may bring those fields back after exploring a better approaches (e.g., by using the new [Terraform Plugin Framework](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/framework)), as currently, our options with the [Terraform SDKv2](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2) are limited in that regard.

### *(breaking change)* Changes in default TOML format
As we have announced in [an earlier entry](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md#new-toml-file-schema), now the provider uses the new TOML format by default (`use_legacy_toml_file` is `false` by default). This means that when you try running the v2 provider with the same provider configuration which worked before, you can get a following error: `Error: 260000: account is empty` error with non-empty `account` configuration after upgrading to v2.

Please adjust your TOML format, basing on our [example](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/2.0.0/docs#examples).

This is a breaking change because it requires adjustments on the user's side.

Read more details in the mentioned [migration guide entry](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md#new-toml-file-schema).

Alternatively, specify `use_legacy_toml_file=true` in your configuration, but this is not recommended. The legacy format is deprecated and will be removed in the next major release (v3).

### *(breaking change)* Changes in TOML configuration file requirements
As we have announced in [an earlier entry](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md#changes-in-toml-configuration-file-requirements), now file permissions are verified by default (`skip_toml_file_permission_verification` is `false` by default). This means that on non-Windows systems, when you run the provider, you can get a following error:
```
could not load config file: config file /Users/user/.snowflake/config has unsafe permissions - 0755
```
Please adjust your file permissions, e.g. `chmod 0600 ~/.snowflake/config`.

This is a breaking change because it requires adjustments on the user's side.

Read more details in the mentioned [migration guide entry](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md#changes-in-toml-configuration-file-requirements).

Alternatively, specify `skip_toml_file_permission_verification=false` in your provider configuration and use the unchanged TOML file, but this is less secure and not recommended.

### *(breaking change)* Improved data type handling for snowflake_masking_policy and snowflake_row_access_policy

The provider bases its logic on data returned from Snowflake. For data types, the responses are not always full, e.g.:
- `NUMBER(20, 4)` can be returned as `NUMBER`;
- `NUMBER` can be returned as `NUMBER`.

When you create an object with data type without specifying its arguments (like `NUMBER` without specified scale and precision), Snowflake fill in the defaults based on [SQL data types reference](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference-data-types).
To be able to detect changes in config properly and to react to some external changes, we updated the way how we handle the data types:
- We use the Snowflake defaults for data types on the provider side; this is the exception to our [common approach of not hardcoding the Snowflake defaults](v1-preparations/CHANGES_BEFORE_V1.md#default-values) in the provider; we decided that the data type default are far less likely to change.
- We save the full data type in the state; specifying `NUMBER` will result in storing `NUMBER(38,0)` in state; the same value will be sent to Snowflake.
- We react to changes in Snowflake only in certain changes; e.g. `NUMBER` -> `VARCHAR`, we can't react on the external change if Snowflake does not return the full data type definition (as above).
- We will gradually add this logic to all the resources. For now, it was only added to the stable resources: [`snowflake_masking_policy`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/2.0.0/docs/resources/masking_policy) and [`snowflake_row_access_policy`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/2.0.0/docs/resources/row_access_policy). We added state upgraders that should handle the state saving changes. There are no changes required, however, you may encounter non-empty plans in these two resources after bumping. Be careful and verify the plan thoroughly as these resources can handle updates only in a destructive manner (this is the limitation of Snowflake SQL syntax for [`ALTER MASKING POLICY`](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/alter-masking-policy) and [`ALTER ROW ACCESS POLICY`](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/alter-row-access-policy)).

### *(bugfix)* Fix CSV_TIMESTAMP_FORMAT handling in snowflake_account_parameters

[`CSV_TIMESTAMP_FORMAT`](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/parameters#csv-timestamp-format) lacked the single quotes in the constructed SQL query. No changes are required.

## v1.2.1 -> v1.2.2

### *(bugfix)* Fix `ENABLE_INTERNAL_STAGES_PRIVATELINK` mapping in `snowflake_account_parameter` resource

Due to incorrect mapping in setting account parameter logic in [`snowflake_account_parameter`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/2.1.0/docs/resources/account_parameter), the [`ENABLE_INTERNAL_STAGES_PRIVATELINK`](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/parameters#enable-internal-stages-privatelink) could not be set. Setting it results in setting the [`ALLOW_ID_TOKEN`](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/parameters#allow-id-token) parameter instead. This version introduces the corrected mapping.

No configuration changes are needed. However, the provider won't set back the `ALLOW_ID_TOKEN` parameter value as we can't detect if setting its value was intentional (manually or through `snowflake_account_parameter`). Because of that, please verify your `ALLOW_ID_TOKEN` parameter and set it to the desired value.

This fix was also backported to versions v1.0.6 and v1.1.1.

### New behavior for Read and Delete operations when removing high-hierarchy objects
Some objects in Snowflake are created in hierarchy, for example, tables (database → schema → table).
When the user wants to remove the higher-hierarchy object (like a database), the lower-hierarchy objects should be removed beforehand.
Otherwise, Terraform would fail to remove the lower-hierarchy objects from the state,
and without manual state management it wouldn't be possible to remove this object, ending up in broken state (reference issue: [#1243](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/1243)).
This may only happen in particular cases, for example, if part of the hierarchy is managed outside Terraform or the configuration is missing dependencies between resources.
This behavior was described more in detail in [our documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/guides/object_renaming_research_summary#renaming-higher-hierarchy-objects).

For improved usability, we adjusted the Read and Delete operation implementations for all resources,
so that now, they're able to know the higher-hierarchy object is missing, and they can safely remove themselves from the state.

To demonstrate this behavior, let's take the following configuration:
```terraform
resource "snowflake_table" "test" {
  database = "TEST_DATABASE"
  schema   = "PUBLIC"
  name     = "TEMP_TABLE"
  column {
    name = "ID"
    type = "NUMBER"
  }
}
```
> Note: The `TEST_DATABASE` is created manually through Snowflake and the table configuration is already applied through Terraform.

When you remove the database by running `DROP DATABASE TEST_DATABASE` in Snowflake, and then run `terraform apply`,
previously, you would end up in the infinite loop of errors and only manual removal from state (`terraform state rm snowflake_table.test`)
would help you to remove the table from the state (and then from the configuration).

In the future, we are planning to do the same with object attachments, like grants, policies, etc. (To address cases like: [#3412](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/3412))

### New TOML file schema
The TOML file schema before v1.2.0 was not consistent with the configuration keys in the provider. The main differences were:
- The keys in the provider contain an underscore (`_`) as a separator, but the TOML schema has fields without any separator.
- The field `driver_tracing` in the provider is related to `tracing` in the TOML schema.

These differences caused some confusion for the users. This is why we decided to introduce a new TOML schema addressing these flaws.
The new schema uses underscore (`_`) as a separator, and changes `tracing` to `driver_tracing` to be consistent with the provider schema.
You can see an example in [our registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/1.2.0/docs#order-precedence).

The default behavior is the same as before v1.2.0. You can enable the new behavior by setting `use_legacy_toml_file = false` in the provider, or by setting `SNOWFLAKE_USE_LEGACY_TOML_FILE=false` environmental variable.
Please note that we will change the default behavior in v2: the new TOML schema will be read by default, but there will still be a possibility to read the old format. However, we encourage you to use our new schema now and give us feedback.

NOTE: With this change, we are not bringing back the `account` field yet. This means that `account_name` and `organization_name` fields must still be used. We will discuss about this field after v2.

### Fixes in handling references to computed fields in context of `show_output`
The issue could arise in almost any object using show_output when the following steps happen:
1. Object is created.
2. Object's attribute is updated to computed value of other object added in this run.

In such situation the final plan could result in error like this one:
```
| Error: Provider produced inconsistent final plan
|
| When expanding the plan for snowflake_legacy_service_user.one to include new
| values learned so far during apply, provider
| "registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/snowflake" produced an invalid new value for
| .show_output: was known, but now unknown.
|
| This is a bug in the provider, which should be reported in the provider's own
| issue tracker.
```

This version fixes this behavior. No action should be required on user side.

### *(bugfix)* Fix `ENABLE_INTERNAL_STAGES_PRIVATELINK` mapping in `snowflake_account_parameter` resource

Due to incorrect mapping in setting account parameter logic in [`snowflake_account_parameter`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/2.1.0/docs/resources/account_parameter), the [`ENABLE_INTERNAL_STAGES_PRIVATELINK`](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/parameters#enable-internal-stages-privatelink) could not be set. Setting it results in setting the [`ALLOW_ID_TOKEN`](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/parameters#allow-id-token) parameter instead. This version introduces the corrected mapping.

No configuration changes are needed. However, the provider won't set back the `ALLOW_ID_TOKEN` parameter value as we can't detect if setting its value was intentional (manually or through `snowflake_account_parameter`). Because of that, please verify your `ALLOW_ID_TOKEN` parameter and set it to the desired value.

This fix was also backported to version v1.0.6.

## v1.0.x ➞ v1.1.0

### Timeouts in resources
By default, resource operation timeout after 20 minutes ([reference](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/retries-and-customizable-timeouts#default-timeouts-and-deadline-exceeded-errors)). This caused some long running operations to timeout.

We already added configurable timeouts to [execute](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/1.0.4/docs/resources/execute#nested-schema-for-timeouts), [tag_association](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/1.0.4/docs/resources/tag_association#nested-schema-for-timeouts) and [cortex_search_service](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/1.0.4/docs/resources/cortex_search_service#nested-schema-for-timeouts) before. Now, we also allow setting them on all other resources.
Data sources will be supported in the future.

Read more about resource timeouts in the [Terraform documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts).

References: [#3355](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/3355)

### Fixes in `grant_privileges_to_account_role` resource
Using `grant_privileges_to_account_role` with `all_privileges=true` and `on_account = true` option started to fail recently due to newly introduced privileges in Snowflake:
```
003011 (42501): Grant partially executed: privileges [MANAGE LISTING AUTO FULFILLMENT, MANAGE ORGANIZATION SUPPORT CASES,
│ MANAGE POLARIS CONNECTIONS] not granted
```

Instead of failing the whole action, we return a warning instead and the operation execution continues, which aligns with the behavior in Snowsight. Note that for `all_privileges=true` the privileges list in the state is not populated, like before. If you want to detect differences in the privileges, use `privileges` list instead. If you want to make sure that the maximum privileges are granted, enable `always_apply`.

### *(bugfix)* Fix `ENABLE_INTERNAL_STAGES_PRIVATELINK` mapping in `snowflake_account_parameter` resource

Due to incorrect mapping in setting account parameter logic in [`snowflake_account_parameter`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/2.1.0/docs/resources/account_parameter), the [`ENABLE_INTERNAL_STAGES_PRIVATELINK`](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/parameters#enable-internal-stages-privatelink) could not be set. Setting it results in setting the [`ALLOW_ID_TOKEN`](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/parameters#allow-id-token) parameter instead. This version introduces the corrected mapping.

No configuration changes are needed. However, the provider won't set back the `ALLOW_ID_TOKEN` parameter value as we can't detect if setting its value was intentional (manually or through `snowflake_account_parameter`). Because of that, please verify your `ALLOW_ID_TOKEN` parameter and set it to the desired value.

## v1.0.4 ➞ v1.0.5

### Changes in TOML configuration file requirements
Before this version, it was possible to abuse the provider by providing a huge TOML config file which was read every time. To mitigate this, we set a limit of the supported file size to 10MB. For a larger TOML configuration file, the provider will fail.

We encourage you to make your TOML configuration file more restricted. Any privileges for a UNIX group or others should not be set (the maximum recommended privilege is `700`). You can set the expected privileges like `chmod 0600 ~/.snowflake/config`. This check is not enabled by default, but we introduced a new `skip_toml_file_permission_verification` boolean field to the provider's configuration with a default `true` value to enable this behavior.

If you want to check the TOML config file privileges, please specify `skip_toml_file_permission_verification=false` in your TF configuration or set `SKIP_TOML_FILE_PERMISSION_VERIFICATION=FALSE` environment variable. For a TOML configuration file with too broad permissions, the provider will fail.
This requirement can be checked only on non-Windows platforms. If you are using the provider on Windows, please make sure that your configuration file has not too permissive privileges.

This setting can be changed to `false` in the future, meaning verifying file permissions by default, so the preferred action is to set the proper permissions now and to disable skipping permission verification.

### Tracking external changes for oauth_redirect_uri in the snowflake_oauth_integration_for_partner_applications resource
From this version, the snowflake_oauth_integration_for_partner_applications resource is able to
detect changes on the Snowflake side and apply appropriate action from the provider level. This may produce
changes after running `terraform plan`, as before the configuration could contain different value than on the Snowflake side.

### Removal of instrumentation library
We decided to remove the instrumentation around the [Go Snowflake driver](https://github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake). It does not introduce any functional changes, however, it changes the way the Snowflake communication logs are turned on and how they are printed. Check [this section](FAQ.md#how-can-i-turn-on-logs) for more details.

`SF_TF_NO_INSTRUMENTED_SQL`, used to turn the instrumentation off, was removed because it is no longer needed.

These changes should not affect any existing workflows (unless you have custom logic based on the old logs output).

### Removal of additional debug logs for the `snowflake_grant_privileges_to_role` resource

The environment variable `SF_TF_ADDITIONAL_DEBUG_LOGGING` was used to turn on the additional logging in the `snowflake_grant_privileges_to_role` resource. The additional logger was later used in multiple other places. We are currently removing it completely; however, we plan to address the logging topic globally in the provider.

These changes should not affect any existing workflows (unless you have custom logic based on the additional logs output - `sf-tf-additional-debug` prefix).

## v1.0.3 ➞ v1.0.4

### Fixed external_function VARCHAR return_type
VARCHAR external_function return_type did not work correctly before ([#3392](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/3392)) but was fixed in this version.

### New Go version and conflicts with Suricata-based firewalls (like AWS Network Firewall)
In this version we bumped our underlying Go version to v1.23.6.
Based on issue [#3421](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/3421)
it seems it introduces changes to the standard library that may not be supported by other third party software.
The issue presents one of those changes that seem to be introduced in Golang's `crypto/tls` package.
One thing that is valuable in such cases is to check the [GODEBUG](https://go.dev/doc/godebug)
documentation page (especially [history section](https://go.dev/doc/godebug#history)).
It specifies a set of parameters which can be turned on/off depending on
what features of Go would you like to use or resign from. The solution for this issue was to set
the GODEBUG environment variable to `GODEBUG=tlskyber=0`.

## v1.0.2 ➞ v1.0.3

### Fixed METRIC_LEVEL parameter
METRIC_LEVEL account parameter did not work correctly before ([#3375](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/3375)), but was fixed in this version.

### Fixed ENFORCE_NETWORK_RULES_FOR_INTERNAL_STAGES parameter
ENFORCE_NETWORK_RULES_FOR_INTERNAL_STAGES account parameter did not work correctly before ([#3344]). This parameter was of incorrect type, and the constructed queries did not provide the parameter's value during altering accounts. It has been fixed in this version.

### Changed documentation structure
We added `Preview` and `Stable` categories to the resources and data sources documentation, which clearly separates the preview and stable features in the documentation feature list.
We moved our technical guides to `guides` directory. This means that all such guides are available natively in the registry, similarly to [Unassigning policies](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/guides/unassigning_policies) guide.
We also updated the links to point to the docs inside the registry. Note that our [Roadmap](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/ROADMAP.md) and [Migration guide](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md) are available in Github only.
This is a part of our effort to improve the provider documentation. We are open for your feedback and suggestions.

## v1.0.1 ➞ v1.0.2

### Fixed migration of account resource
Previously, during upgrading the provider from v0.99.0, when account fields `must_change_password` or `is_org_admin` were not set in state, the provider panicked. It has been fixed in this version.

### Add missing resource monitor in `snowflake_grant_ownership` resource
Resource monitor in not currently listed as option in `GRANT OWNERSHIP` documentation ([here](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/grant-ownership#required-parameters)) but this is a valid option. `snowflake_grant_ownership` was updated to support resource monitors.

References: [#3318](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/3318)

### Timeouts in `snowflake_execute`
By default, resource operation timeouts after 20 minutes ([reference](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/retries-and-customizable-timeouts#default-timeouts-and-deadline-exceeded-errors)). Because of generic nature of `snowflake_execute`, we decided to bump its default timeouts to 60 minutes; We also allowed setting them on the resource config level (following [official documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts)).

References: [#3334](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/3334)

## v1.0.0 ➞ v1.0.1

### Fixes in account parameters
As a follow-up of reworked `snowflake_account_parameter`, this version has several improvements regarding handling parameters.

#### Add missing parameters based on the docs and output of SHOW PARAMETERS IN ACCOUNT
Based on [parameters docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/parameters) and `SHOW PARAMETERS IN ACCOUNT`, we established a list of supported parameters. New supported or fixed parameters in `snowflake_account_parameter`:
- `ACTIVE_PYTHON_PROFILER`
- `CLIENT_ENABLE_LOG_INFO_STATEMENT_PARAMETERS`
- `CORTEX_ENABLED_CROSS_REGION`
- `CSV_TIMESTAMP_FORMAT`
- `ENABLE_PERSONAL_DATABASE`
- `ENABLE_UNHANDLED_EXCEPTIONS_REPORTING`
- `ENFORCE_NETWORK_RULES_FOR_INTERNAL_STAGES`
- `HYBRID_TABLE_LOCK_TIMEOUT`
- `JS_TREAT_INTEGER_AS_BIGINT`
- `PREVENT_UNLOAD_TO_INLINE_URL`
- `PREVENT_UNLOAD_TO_INTERNAL_STAGES`
- `PYTHON_PROFILER_MODULES`
- `PYTHON_PROFILER_TARGET_STAGE`
- `STORAGE_SERIALIZATION_POLICY`
- `TASK_AUTO_RETRY_ATTEMPTS`

#### Adjusted validations
Validations for number parameters are now relaxed. This is because a few of the value limits are soft limits in Snowflake, and can be changed externally.
We decided to keep validations for non-negative values. Affected parameters:
- `QUERY_TAG`
- `TWO_DIGIT_CENTURY_START`
- `WEEK_OF_YEAR_POLICY`
- `WEEK_START`
- `USER_TASK_TIMEOUT_MS`

We added non-negative validations for the following parameters:
- `CLIENT_PREFETCH_THREADS`
- `CLIENT_RESULT_CHUNK_SIZE`
- `CLIENT_SESSION_KEEP_ALIVE_HEARTBEAT_FREQUENCY`
- `HYBRID_TABLE_LOCK_TIMEOUT`
- `JSON_INDENT`
- `STATEMENT_QUEUED_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS`
- `STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS`
- `TASK_AUTO_RETRY_ATTEMPTS`
- `USER_TASK_MINIMUM_TRIGGER_INTERVAL_IN_SECONDS`

Note that enum parameters are still not validated by the provider - they are only validated in Snowflake. We will handle this during a small rework of the parameters in the future.

### Add missing preview features to config

Values:
- `snowflake_functions_datasource`
- `snowflake_procedures_datasource`
- `snowflake_tables_datasource`
  were missing in the `preview_features_enabled` attribute in the provider's config. They were added.

References: #3302

### functions and procedures docs updated

Argument names are automatically wrapped in double quotes, so:
- uppercase names should be used or
- argument name should be quoted in the procedure/function definition.

Updated the docs and the previous migration guide entry.

References: #3298

### python procedure docs updated

Importing python procedure is currently limited to procedures with snowflake-snowpark-python version explicitly set in Snowflake. Docs were updated.

References: #3303

## v0.100.0 ➞ v1.0.0

If you want to have them enabled, add the feature name to the provider configuration (with `_datasource` or `_resource` suffix), like this:
```terraform
provider "snowflake" {
	preview_features_enabled = ["snowflake_current_account_datasource", "snowflake_alert_resource"]
}
```

Do not forget to add this line to all provider configurations using these features, including [provider aliases](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/providers/configuration#alias-multiple-provider-configurations).

## v0.99.0 ➞ v0.100.0

### *(preview feature/deprecation)* Function and procedure resources

`snowflake_function` is now deprecated in favor of 5 new preview resources:

- `snowflake_function_java`
- `snowflake_function_javascript`
- `snowflake_function_python`
- `snowflake_function_scala`
- `snowflake_function_sql`

It will be removed with the v1 release. Please check the docs for the new resources and adjust your configuration files.
For no downtime migration, follow our [guide](./docs/guides/resource_migration.md).

The new resources are more aligned with current features like:
- external access integrations support
- secrets support
- argument default values

**Note**: argument names are now quoted automatically by the provider so remember about this while writing the function definition (argument name should be quoted or uppercase should be used for the argument name).

`snowflake_procedure` is now deprecated in favor of 5 new preview resources:

- `snowflake_procedure_java`
- `snowflake_procedure_javascript`
- `snowflake_procedure_python`
- `snowflake_procedure_scala`
- `snowflake_procedure_sql`

It will be removed with the v1 release. Please check the docs for the new resources and adjust your configuration files.
For no downtime migration, follow our [guide](./docs/guides/resource_migration.md).

The new resources are more aligned with current features like:
- external access integrations support
- secrets support
- argument default values

**Note**: argument names are now quoted automatically by the provider so remember about this while writing the procedure definition (argument name should be quoted or uppercase should be used for the argument name).

### *(new feature)* Account role data source
Added a new `snowflake_account_roles` data source for account roles. Now it reflects It's based on `snowflake_roles` data source.
`account_roles` field now organizes output of show under `show_output` field.

Before:
```terraform
output "simple_output" {
  value = data.snowflake_roles.test.roles[0].show_output[0].name
}
```
After:
```terraform
output "simple_output" {
  value = data.snowflake_account_roles.test.account_roles[0].show_output[0].name
}
```

### snowflake_roles data source deprecation
`snowflake_roles` is now deprecated in favor of `snowflake_account_roles` with a similar schema and behavior. It will be removed with the v1 release. Please adjust your configuration files.

### snowflake_account_parameter resource changes

#### *(behavior change)* resource deletion
During resource deleting, provider now uses `UNSET` instead of `SET` with the default value.

#### *(behavior change)* changes in `key` field
The value of `key` field is now case-insensitive and is validated. The list of supported values is available in the resource documentation.

### unsafe_execute resource deprecation / new execute resource

The `snowflake_unsafe_execute` gets deprecated in favor of the new resource `snowflake_execute`.
The `snowflake_execute` was build on top of `snowflake_unsafe_execute` with a few improvements.
The unsafe version will be removed with the v1 release, so please migrate to the `snowflake_execute` resource.

For no downtime migration, follow our [guide](./docs/guides/resource_migration.md).
When importing, remember that the given resource id has to be unique (using UUIDs is recommended).
Also, because of the nature of the resource, first apply after importing is necessary to "copy" values from the configuration to the state.

### snowflake_oauth_integration_for_partner_applications and snowflake_oauth_integration_for_custom_clients resource changes
#### *(behavior change)* `blocked_roles_list` field is no longer required

Previously, `blocked_roles_list` field was required to handle default account roles like `ACCOUNTADMIN`, `ORGADMIN`, and `SECURITYADMIN`.

Now, it is optional, because of using the value of `OAUTH_ADD_PRIVILEGED_ROLES_TO_BLOCKED_LIST` parameter (read more below).

No changes in the configuration are necessary.

#### *(behavior change)* new field `related_parameters`

To handle `blocked_roles_list` field properly in both of the resources, we introduce `related_parameters` field. This field is a list of parameters related to OAuth integrations. It is a computed-only field containing value of `OAUTH_ADD_PRIVILEGED_ROLES_TO_BLOCKED_LIST` account parameter (see [docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/parameters#oauth-add-privileged-roles-to-blocked-list)).

### snowflake_account resource changes

Changes:
- `admin_user_type` is now supported. No action required during the migration.
- `grace_period_in_days` is now required. The field should be explicitly set in the following versions.
- Account renaming is now supported.
- `is_org_admin` is a settable field (previously it was read-only field). Changing its value is also supported.
- `must_change_password` and `is_org_admin` type was changed from `bool` to bool-string (more on that [here](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/v1-preparations/CHANGES_BEFORE_V1.md#empty-values)). No action required during the migration.
- The underlying resource identifier was changed from `<account_locator>` to `<organization_name>.<account_name>`. Migration will be done automatically. Notice this introduces changes in how `snowflake_account` resource is imported.
- New `show_output` field was added (see [raw Snowflake output](./v1-preparations/CHANGES_BEFORE_V1.md#raw-snowflake-output)).

### snowflake_accounts data source changes
New filtering options:
- `with_history`

New output fields
- `show_output`

Breaking changes:
- `pattern` renamed to `like`
- `accounts` field now organizes output of show under `show_output` field and the output of show parameters under `parameters` field.

Before:
```terraform
output "simple_output" {
  value = data.snowflake_accounts.test.accounts[0].account_name
}
```
After:
```terraform
output "simple_output" {
  value = data.snowflake_accounts.test.accounts[0].show_output[0].account_name
}
```

### snowflake_tag_association resource changes

#### *(behavior change)* new id format
To provide more functionality for tagging objects, we have changed the resource id from `"TAG_DATABASE"."TAG_SCHEMA"."TAG_NAME"` to `"TAG_DATABASE"."TAG_SCHEMA"."TAG_NAME"|TAG_VALUE|OBJECT_TYPE`.

The state is migrated automatically. There is no need to adjust configuration files, unless you use resource id `snowflake_tag_association.example.id` as a reference in other resources.

This change allows to group tags associations per tag ID, tag value and object type in one resource, like so:

```terraform
resource "snowflake_tag_association" "gold_warehouses" {
  object_identifiers = [snowflake_warehouse.w1.fully_qualified_name, snowflake_warehouse.w2.fully_qualified_name]
  object_type = "WAREHOUSE"
  tag_id      = snowflake_tag.tier.fully_qualified_name
  tag_value   = "gold"
}

resource "snowflake_tag_association" "silver_warehouses" {
  object_identifiers = [snowflake_warehouse.w3.fully_qualified_name]
  object_type = "WAREHOUSE"
  tag_id      = snowflake_tag.tier.fully_qualified_name
  tag_value   = "silver"
}

resource "snowflake_tag_association" "silver_databases" {
  object_identifiers = [snowflake_database.d1.fully_qualified_name]
  object_type = "DATABASE"
  tag_id      = snowflake_tag.tier.fully_qualified_name
  tag_value   = "silver"
}
```

Note that if you want to promote `silver` instances to `gold`, you cannot change the `tag_value` in `silver_warehouses` to `gold`.
Instead, you should first remove `object_identifiers` from `silver_warehouses`, run `terraform apply`.
Your configuration should like as follows:

```terraform
resource "snowflake_tag_association" "silver_databases" {
  object_identifiers = [snowflake_database.d1.fully_qualified_name]
  object_type = "DATABASE"
  tag_id      = snowflake_tag.tier.fully_qualified_name
  tag_value   = "silver"
}

## "snowflake_tag_association" "silver_warehouses" was removed

resource "snowflake_tag_association" "gold_warehouses" {
  object_identifiers = [snowflake_warehouse.w1.fully_qualified_name, snowflake_warehouse.w2.fully_qualified_name]
  object_type = "WAREHOUSE"
  tag_id      = snowflake_tag.tier.fully_qualified_name
  tag_value   = "gold"
}
```

Then, add the relevant object identifiers in `gold_warehouses`'s `object_identifiers` field.
With those changes, you should end up with the following configuration:

```terraform
resource "snowflake_tag_association" "silver_databases" {
  object_identifiers = [snowflake_database.d1.fully_qualified_name]
  object_type = "DATABASE"
  tag_id      = snowflake_tag.tier.fully_qualified_name
  tag_value   = "silver"
}

resource "snowflake_tag_association" "gold_warehouses" {
  object_identifiers = [snowflake_warehouse.w1.fully_qualified_name, snowflake_warehouse.w2.fully_qualified_name, snowflake_warehouse.w3.fully_qualified_name] # New warehouse was added
  object_type = "WAREHOUSE"
  tag_id      = snowflake_tag.tier.fully_qualified_name
  tag_value   = "gold"
}
```
and run `terraform apply` again.

> Note: This operation has to be done in two steps. Otherwise, they will run in the non-deterministic order and may end up in the incorrect state.

#### *(behavior change)* changed fields
Behavior of some fields was changed:
- `object_identifier` was renamed to `object_identifiers` and it is now a set of fully qualified names. Change your configurations from
```
resource "snowflake_tag_association" "table_association" {
  object_identifier {
    name     = snowflake_table.test.name
    database = snowflake_database.test.name
    schema   = snowflake_schema.test.name
  }
  object_type = "TABLE"
  tag_id      = snowflake_tag.test.fully_qualified_name
  tag_value   = "engineering"
}
```
to
```
resource "snowflake_tag_association" "table_association" {
  object_identifiers = [snowflake_table.test.fully_qualified_name]
  object_type = "TABLE"
  tag_id      = snowflake_tag.test.fully_qualified_name
  tag_value   = "engineering"
}
```
- `tag_id`  has now suppressed identifier quoting to prevent issues with Terraform showing permanent differences, like [this one](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/2982)
- `object_type` and `tag_id` are now marked as ForceNew

The state is migrated automatically. Please adjust your configuration files.

### Data type changes

As part of reworking functions, procedures, and any other resource utilizing Snowflake data types, we adjusted the parsing of data types to be more aligned with Snowflake (according to [docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/intro-summary-data-types)).

Affected resources:
- `snowflake_function`
- `snowflake_procedure`
- `snowflake_table`
- `snowflake_external_function`
- `snowflake_masking_policy`
- `snowflake_row_access_policy`
- `snowflake_dynamic_table`
You may encounter non-empty plans in these resources after bumping.

Changes to the previous implementation/limitations:
- `BOOL` is no longer supported; use `BOOLEAN` instead.
- Following the change described [here](#bugfix-handle-data-type-diff-suppression-better-for-text-and-number), comparing and suppressing changes of data types was extended for all other data types with the following rules:
  - `CHARACTER`, `CHAR`, `NCHAR` now have the default size set to 1 if not provided (following the [docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/data-types-text#char-character-nchar))
  - `BINARY` has default size set to 8388608 if not provided (following the [docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/data-types-text#binary))
  - `TIME` has default precision set to 9 if not provided (following the [docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/data-types-datetime#time))
  - `TIMESTAMP_LTZ` has default precision set to 9 if not provided (following the [docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/data-types-datetime#timestamp)); supported aliases: `TIMESTAMPLTZ`, `TIMESTAMP WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE`.
  - `TIMESTAMP_NTZ` has default precision set to 9 if not provided (following the [docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/data-types-datetime#timestamp)); supported aliases: `TIMESTAMPNTZ`, `TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE`, `DATETIME`.
  - `TIMESTAMP_TZ` has default precision set to 9 if not provided (following the [docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/data-types-datetime#timestamp)); supported aliases: `TIMESTAMPTZ`, `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE`.
- The session-settable `TIMESTAMP` is NOT supported ([docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/data-types-datetime#timestamp))
- `VECTOR` type still is limited and will be addressed soon (probably before the release so it will be edited)

## v0.98.0 ➞ v0.99.0

### snowflake_tasks data source changes

New filtering options:
- `with_parameters`
- `like`
- `in`
- `starts_with`
- `root_only`
- `limit`

New output fields
- `show_output`
- `parameters`

Breaking changes:
- `database` and `schema` are right now under `in` field

Before:
```terraform
data "snowflake_tasks" "old_tasks" {
  database = "<database_name>"
  schema = "<schema_name>"
}
```
After:
```terraform
data "snowflake_tasks" "new_tasks" {
  in {
    # for IN SCHEMA specify:
    schema = "<database_name>.<schema_name>"

    # for IN DATABASE specify:
    database = "<database_name>"
  }
}
```
- `tasks` field now organizes output of show under `show_output` field and the output of show parameters under `parameters` field.

Before:
```terraform
output "simple_output" {
  value = data.snowflake_tasks.test.tasks[0].name
}
```
After:
```terraform
output "simple_output" {
  value = data.snowflake_tasks.test.tasks[0].show_output[0].name
}
```

### snowflake_task resource changes
New fields:
- `config` - enables to specify JSON-formatted metadata that can be retrieved in the `sql_statement` by using [SYSTEM$GET_TASK_GRAPH_CONFIG](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/system_get_task_graph_config).
- `show_output` and `parameters` fields added for holding SHOW and SHOW PARAMETERS output (see [raw Snowflake output](./v1-preparations/CHANGES_BEFORE_V1.md#raw-snowflake-output)).
- Added support for finalizer tasks with `finalize` field. It conflicts with `after` and `schedule` (see [finalizer tasks](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/tasks-graphs#release-and-cleanup-of-task-graphs)).

Changes:
- `enabled` field changed to `started` and type changed to string with only boolean values available (see ["empty" values](./v1-preparations/CHANGES_BEFORE_V1.md#empty-values)). It is also now required field, so make sure it's explicitly set (previously it was optional with the default value set to `false`).
- `allow_overlapping_execution` type was changed to string with only boolean values available (see ["empty" values](./v1-preparations/CHANGES_BEFORE_V1.md#empty-values)). Previously, it had the default set to `false` which will be migrated. If nothing will be set the provider will plan the change to `default` value. If you want to make sure it's turned off, set it explicitly to `false`.

Before:
```terraform
resource "snowflake_task" "example" {
  # ...
  enabled = true
  # ...
}
```
After:
```terraform
resource "snowflake_task" "example" {
  # ...
  started = true
  # ...
}
```
- `schedule` field changed from single value to a nested object that allows for specifying either minutes or cron

Before:
```terraform
resource "snowflake_task" "example" {
  # ...
  schedule = "5 MINUTES"
  # or
  schedule = "USING CRON * * * * * UTC"
  # ...
}
```
After:
```terraform
resource "snowflake_task" "example" {
  # ...
  schedule {
    minutes = 5
    # or
    using_cron = "* * * * * UTC"
  }
  # ...
}
```
- All task parameters defined in [the Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/parameters) added into the top-level schema and removed `session_parameters` map.

Before:
```terraform
resource "snowflake_task" "example" {
  # ...
  session_parameters = {
    QUERY_TAG = "<query_tag>"
  }
  # ...
}
```
After:
```terraform
resource "snowflake_task" "example" {
  # ...
  query_tag = "<query_tag>"
  # ...
}
```

- `after` field type was changed from `list` to `set` and the values were changed from names to fully qualified names.

Before:
```terraform
resource "snowflake_task" "example" {
  # ...
  after = ["<task_name>", snowflake_task.some_task.name]
  # ...
}
```
After:
```terraform
resource "snowflake_task" "example" {
  # ...
  after = ["<database_name>.<schema_name>.<task_name>", snowflake_task.some_task.fully_qualified_name]
  # ...
}
```

### *(new feature)* snowflake_tags datasource
Added a new datasource enabling querying and filtering tags. Notes:
- all results are stored in `tags` field.
- `like` field enables tags filtering by name.
- `in` field enables tags filtering by `account`, `database`, `schema`, `application` and `application_package`.
- `SHOW TAGS` output is enclosed in `show_output` field inside `tags`.

### snowflake_tag_masking_policy_association deprecation
`snowflake_tag_masking_policy_association` is now deprecated in favor of `snowflake_tag` with a new `masking_policy` field. It will be removed with the v1 release. Please adjust your configuration files.

### snowflake_tag resource changes
New fields:
  - `masking_policies` field that holds the associated masking policies.
  - `show_output` field that holds the response from SHOW TAGS.

#### *(breaking change)* Changed fields in snowflake_masking_policy resource
Changed fields:
  - `name` is now not marked as ForceNew. When this value is changed, the resource is renamed with `ALTER TAG`, instead of being recreated.
  - `allowed_values` type was changed from list to set. This causes different ordering to be ignored.
State will be migrated automatically.

#### *(breaking change)* Identifiers related changes
During [identifiers rework](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/ROADMAP.md#identifiers-rework) we decided to
migrate resource ids from pipe-separated to regular Snowflake identifiers (e.g. `<database_name>|<schema_name>` -> `"<database_name>"."<schema_name>"`). Importing resources also needs to be adjusted (see [example](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/tag#import)).

Also, we added diff suppress function that prevents Terraform from showing differences, when only quoting is different.

No change is required, the state will be migrated automatically.

#### *(breaking change)* Required warehouse
For this resource, the provider now uses [tag references](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/tag_references) to get information about masking policies attached to tags. This function requires a warehouse in the connection. Please, make sure you have either set a `DEFAULT_WAREHOUSE` for the user, or specified a warehouse in the provider configuration.

## v0.97.0 ➞ v0.98.0

### *(new feature)* snowflake_connections datasource
Added a new datasource enabling querying and filtering connections. Notes:
- all results are stored in `connections` field.
- `like` field enables connections filtering.
- SHOW CONNECTIONS output is enclosed in `show_output` field inside `connections`.
  It's important to limit the records and calls to Snowflake to the minimum. That's why we recommend assessing which information you need from the data source and then providing strong filters and turning off additional fields for better plan performance.


### *(new feature)* connection resources

Added a new resources for managing connections. We decided to split connection into two separate resources based on whether the connection is a primary or replicated (secondary). i.e.:

- `snowflake_primary_connection` is used to manage primary connection, with ability to enable failover to other accounts.
- `snowflake_secondary_connection` is used to manage replicated (secondary) connection.

To promote `snowflake_secondary_connection` to `snowflake_primary_connection`, resources need to be removed from the state, altered manually using:
```
ALTER CONNECTION <name> PRIMARY;
```
and then imported again, now as `snowflake_primary_connection`.

To demote `snowflake_primary_connection` back to `snowflake_secondary_connection`, resources need to be removed from the state, re-created manually using:
```
CREATE CONNECTION <name> AS REPLICA OF <organization_name>.<account_name>.<connection_name>;
```
and then imported as `snowflake_secondary_connection`.

For guidance on removing and importing resources into the state check [resource migration](./docs/guides/resource_migration.md).

See reference [docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-connection).

### snowflake_streams data source changes
New filtering options:
- `like`
- `in`
- `starts_with`
- `limit`
- `with_describe`

New output fields
- `show_output`
- `describe_output`

Breaking changes:
- `database` and `schema` are right now under `in` field
- `streams` field now organizes output of show under `show_output` field and the output of describe under `describe_output` field.

Please adjust your Terraform configuration files.

### *(behavior change)* Provider configuration rework
On our road to v1, we have decided to rework configuration to address the most common issues (see a [roadmap entry](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/ROADMAP.md#providers-configuration-rework)). We have created a list of topics we wanted to address before v1. We will prepare an announcement soon. The following subsections describe the things addressed in the v0.98.0.

#### *(behavior change)* new fields
We have added new fields to match the ones in [the driver](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake#Config) and to simplify setting account name. Specifically:
- `include_retry_reason`, `max_retry_count`, `driver_tracing`, `tmp_directory_path` and `disable_console_login` are the new fields that are supported in the driver
- `disable_saml_url_check` will be added to the provider after upgrading the driver
- `account_name` and `organization_name` were added to improve handling account names. Execute `SELECT CURRENT_ORGANIZATION_NAME(), CURRENT_ACCOUNT_NAME();` to get the required values. Read more in [docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-account-identifier#using-an-account-name-as-an-identifier).

#### *(behavior change)* changed configuration of driver log level
To be more consistent with other configuration options, we have decided to add `driver_tracing` to the configuration schema. This value can also be configured by `SNOWFLAKE_DRIVER_TRACING` environmental variable and by `drivertracing` field in the TOML file. The previous `SF_TF_GOSNOWFLAKE_LOG_LEVEL` environmental variable is not supported now, and was removed from the provider.

#### *(behavior change)* deprecated fields
Because of new fields `account_name` and `organization_name`, `account` is now deprecated. It will be removed with the v1 release.
If you use Terraform configuration file, adjust it from
```terraform
provider "snowflake" {
	account = "ORGANIZATION-ACCOUNT"
}
```

to
```terraform
provider "snowflake" {
	organization_name = "ORGANIZATION"
	account_name    = "ACCOUNT"
}
```

If you use TOML configuration file, adjust it from
```toml
[default]
	account = "ORGANIZATION-ACCOUNT"
```

to
```toml
[default]
	organizationname = "ORGANIZATION"
	accountname    = "ACCOUNT"
```

If you use environmental variables, adjust them from
```bash
SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT = "ORGANIZATION-ACCOUNT"
```

```bash
SNOWFLAKE_ORGANIZATION_NAME = "ORGANIZATION"
SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT_NAME = "ACCOUNT"
```

This change may cause the connection host URL to change. If you get errors like
```
Error: open snowflake connection: Post "https://ORGANIZATION-ACCOUNT.snowflakecomputing.com:443/session/v1/login-request?requestId=[guid]&request_guid=[guid]&roleName=myrole": EOF
```
make sure that the host `ORGANIZATION-ACCOUNT.snowflakecomputing.com` is allowed to be reached from your network (i.e. not blocked by a firewall).

#### *(behavior change)* changed behavior of some fields
For the fields that are not deprecated, we focused on improving validations and documentation. Also, we adjusted some fields to match our [driver's](https://github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake) defaults. Specifically:
- Relaxed validations for enum fields like `protocol` and `authenticator`. Now, the case on such fields is ignored.
- `user`, `warehouse`, `role` - added a validation for an account object identifier
- `validate_default_parameters`, `client_request_mfa_token`, `client_store_temporary_credential`, `ocsp_fail_open`,  - to easily handle three-value logic (true, false, unknown) in provider's config, type of these fields was changed from boolean to string. For more details about default values, please refer to the [changes before v1](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/v1-preparations/CHANGES_BEFORE_V1.md#default-values) document.
- `client_ip` - added a validation for an IP address
- `port` - added a validation for a port number
- `okta_url`, `token_accessor.token_endpoint`, `client_store_temporary_credential` - added a validation for a URL address
- `login_timeout`, `request_timeout`, `jwt_expire_timeout`, `client_timeout`, `jwt_client_timeout`, `external_browser_timeout` - added a validation for setting this value to at least `0`
- `authenticator` - added a possibility to configure JWT flow with `SNOWFLAKE_JWT` (formerly, this was supported with `JWT`); the previous value `JWT` was left for compatibility, but will be removed before v1

### *(behavior change)* handling copy_grants
Currently, resources like `snowflake_view`, `snowflake_stream_on_table`, `snowflake_stream_on_external_table` and `snowflake_stream_on_directory_table`  support `copy_grants` field corresponding with `COPY GRANTS` during `CREATE`. The current behavior is that, when a change leading for recreation is detected (meaning a change that can not be handled by ALTER, but only by `CREATE OR REPLACE`), `COPY GRANTS` are used during recreation when `copy_grants` is set to `true`. Changing this field without changes in other field results in a noop because in this case there is no need to recreate a resource.

### *(new feature)* recovering stale streams
Starting from this version, the provider detects stale streams for `snowflake_stream_on_table`, `snowflake_stream_on_external_table` and `snowflake_stream_on_directory_table` and recreates them (optionally with `copy_grants`) to recover them. To handle this correctly, a new computed-only field `stale` has been added to these resource, indicating whether a stream is stale.

### *(new feature)* snowflake_stream_on_directory_table and snowflake_stream_on_view resource
Continuing changes made in [v0.97](#v0960--v0970), the new resource `snowflake_stream_on_directory_table` and `snowflake_stream_on_view` have been introduced to replace the previous `snowflake_stream` for streams on directory tables and streams on views.

To use the new `stream_on_directory_table`, change the old `stream` from
```terraform
resource "snowflake_stream" "stream" {
  name     = "stream"
  schema   = "schema"
  database = "database"

  on_stage    = snowflake_stage.stage.fully_qualified_name

  comment = "A stream."
}
```

to

```terraform
resource "snowflake_stream_on_directory_table" "stream" {
  name     = "stream"
  schema   = "schema"
  database = "database"

  stage             = snowflake_stage.stage.fully_qualified_name

  comment = "A stream."
}
```

To use the new `stream_on_view`, change the old `stream` from
```terraform
resource "snowflake_stream" "stream" {
  name     = "stream"
  schema   = "schema"
  database = "database"

  on_view    = snowflake_view.view.fully_qualified_name

  comment = "A stream."
}
```

to

```terraform
resource "snowflake_stream_on_view" "stream" {
  name     = "stream"
  schema   = "schema"
  database = "database"

  view             = snowflake_view.view.fully_qualified_name

  comment = "A stream."
}
```

Then, follow our [Resource migration guide](./docs/guides/resource_migration.md).

### *(new feature)* Secret resources
Added a new secrets resources for managing secrets.
We decided to split each secret flow into individual resources.
This segregation was based on the secret flows in CREATE SECRET. i.e.:
- `snowflake_secret_with_client_credentials`
- `snowflake_secret_with_authorization_code_grant`
- `snowflake_secret_with_basic_authentication`
- `snowflake_secret_with_generic_string`


See reference [docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-secret).

### *(bugfix)* Handle BCR Bundle 2024_08 in snowflake_user resource

[bcr 2024_08](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/bcr-bundles/2024_08/bcr-1798) changed the "empty" response in the `SHOW USERS` query. This provider version adapts to the new result types; it should be used if you want to have 2024_08 Bundle enabled on your account.

Note: Because [bcr 2024_07](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/bcr-bundles/2024_07/bcr-1692) changes the way how the `default_secondary_roles` attribute behaves, drift may be reported when enabling 2024_08 Bundle. Check [Handling default secondary roles](#breaking-change-handling-default-secondary-roles) for more context.

Connected issues: [#3125](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/3125)

### *(bugfix)* Handle user import correctly

#### Context before the change

Password is empty after the `snowflake_user` import; we can't read it from the config or from Snowflake.
During the next terraform plan+apply it's updated to the "same" value.
It results in an error on Snowflake side: `New password rejected by current password policy. Reason: 'PRIOR_USE'.`

#### After the change

The error will be ignored on the provider side (after all, it means that the password in state is the same as on Snowflake side). Still, plan+apply is needed after importing user.

## v0.96.0 ➞ v0.97.0

### *(new feature)* snowflake_stream_on_table, snowflake_stream_on_external_table resource

To enhance clarity and functionality, the new resources `snowflake_stream_on_table` and `snowflake_stream_on_external_table` have been introduced to replace the previous `snowflake_stream`. Recognizing that the old resource carried multiple responsibilities within a single entity, we opted to divide it into more specialized resources.
The newly introduced resources are aligned with the latest Snowflake documentation at the time of implementation, and adhere to our [new conventions](#general-changes).
This segregation was based on the object on which the stream is created. The mapping between SQL statements and the resources is the following:
- `ON TABLE <table_name>` -> `snowflake_stream_on_table`
- `ON EXTERNAL TABLE <external_table_name>` -> `snowflake_stream_on_external_table` (this was previously not supported)

The resources for streams on directory tables and streams on views will be implemented in the future releases.

To use the new `stream_on_table`, change the old `stream` from
```terraform
resource "snowflake_stream" "stream" {
  name     = "stream"
  schema   = "schema"
  database = "database"

  on_table    = snowflake_table.table.fully_qualified_name
  append_only = true

  comment = "A stream."
}
```

to

```terraform
resource "snowflake_stream_on_table" "stream" {
  name     = "stream"
  schema   = "schema"
  database = "database"

  table             = snowflake_table.table.fully_qualified_name
  append_only       = "true"

  comment = "A stream."
}
```


Then, follow our [Resource migration guide](./docs/guides/resource_migration.md).

### *(new feature)* new snowflake_service_user and snowflake_legacy_service_user resources

Release v0.95.0 introduced reworked `snowflake_user` resource. As [noted](#note-user-types), the new `SERVICE` and `LEGACY_SERVICE` user types were not supported.

This release introduces two new resources to handle these new user types: `snowflake_service_user` and `snowflake_legacy_service_user`.

Both resources have schemas almost identical to the `snowflake_user` resource with the following exceptions:
- `snowflake_service_user` does not contain the following fields (because they are not supported for the user of type `SERVICE` in Snowflake):
  - `password`
  - `first_name`
  - `middle_name`
  - `last_name`
  - `must_change_password`
  - `mins_to_bypass_mfa`
  - `disable_mfa`
- `snowflake_legacy_service_user` does not contain the following fields (because they are not supported for the user of type `LEGACY_SERVICE` in Snowflake):
  - `first_name`
  - `middle_name`
  - `last_name`
  - `mins_to_bypass_mfa`
  - `disable_mfa`

`snowflake_users` datasource was adjusted to handle different user types and `type` field was added to the `describe_output`.

If you used to manage service or legacy service users through `snowflake_user` resource (e.g. using `lifecycle.ignore_changes`) or `snowflake_unsafe_execute`, please migrate to the new resources following [our guidelines on resource migration](docs/guides/resource_migration.md).

E.g. change the old config from:

```terraform
resource "snowflake_user" "service_user" {
  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [user_type]
  }

  name         = "Snowflake Service User"
  login_name   = "service_user"
  email        = "service_user@snowflake.example"

  rsa_public_key   = "..."
  rsa_public_key_2 = "..."
}
```

to

```
resource "snowflake_service_user" "service_user" {
  name         = "Snowflake Service User"
  login_name   = "service_user"
  email        = "service_user@snowflake.example"

  rsa_public_key   = "..."
  rsa_public_key_2 = "..."
}

```

Then, follow our [resource migration guide](./docs/guides/resource_migration.md).

## v0.95.0 ➞ v0.96.0

### snowflake_masking_policies data source changes
New filtering options:
- `in`
- `limit`
- `with_describe`

New output fields
- `show_output`
- `describe_output`

Breaking changes:
- `database` and `schema` are right now under `in` field
- `masking_policies` field now organizes output of show under `show_output` field and the output of describe under `describe_output` field.

Please adjust your Terraform configuration files.

### snowflake_masking_policy resource changes
New fields:
  - `show_output` field that holds the response from SHOW MASKING POLICIES.
  - `describe_output` field that holds the response from DESCRIBE MASKING POLICY.

#### *(breaking change)* Renamed fields in snowflake_masking_policy resource
Renamed fields:
  - `masking_expression` to `body`
Please rename these fields in your configuration files. State will be migrated automatically.

#### *(breaking change)* Removed fields from snowflake_masking_policy resource
Removed fields:
- `or_replace`
- `if_not_exists`
The value of these field will be removed from the state automatically.

#### *(breaking change)* Adjusted schema of arguments/signature
The field `signature` is renamed to `arguments` to be consistent with other resources.
Now, arguments are stored without nested `column` field. Please adjust that in your configs, like in the example below. State is migrated automatically.

The old configuration looks like this:
```
  signature {
    column {
      name = "val"
      type = "VARCHAR"
    }
  }
```

The new configuration looks like this:
```
  argument {
    name = "val"
    type = "VARCHAR"
  }
```

#### *(breaking change)* Identifiers related changes
During [identifiers rework](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/ROADMAP.md#identifiers-rework) we decided to
migrate resource ids from pipe-separated to regular Snowflake identifiers (e.g. `<database_name>|<schema_name>` -> `"<database_name>"."<schema_name>"`). Importing resources also needs to be adjusted (see [example](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/row_access_policy#import)).

Also, we added diff suppress function that prevents Terraform from showing differences, when only quoting is different.

No change is required, the state will be migrated automatically.

#### *(behavior change)* Boolean type changes
To easily handle three-value logic (true, false, unknown) in provider's configs, type of `exempt_other_policies` was changed from boolean to string.

For more details about default values, please refer to the [changes before v1](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/v1-preparations/CHANGES_BEFORE_V1.md#default-values) document.

### *(breaking change)* resource_monitor resource
Removed fields:
- `set_for_account` (will be settable on account resource, right now, the preferred way is to set it through unsafe_execute resource)
- `warehouses` (can be set on warehouse resource, optionally through unsafe_execute resource only if the warehouse is not managed by Terraform)
- `suspend_triggers` (now, `suspend_trigger` should be used)
- `suspend_immediate_triggers` (now, `suspend_immediate_trigger` should be used)

### *(breaking change)* resource_monitor data source
Changes:
- New filtering option `like`
- Now, the output of `SHOW RESOURCE MONITORS` is now inside `resource_monitors.*.show_output`. Here's the list of currently available fields:
    - `name`
    - `credit_quota`
    - `used_credits`
    - `remaining_credits`
    - `level`
    - `frequency`
    - `start_time`
    - `end_time`
    - `suspend_at`
    - `suspend_immediate_at`
    - `created_on`
    - `owner`
    - `comment`

### snowflake_row_access_policies data source changes
New filtering options:
- `in`
- `limit`
- `with_describe`

New output fields
- `show_output`
- `describe_output`

Breaking changes:
- `database` and `schema` are right now under `in` field
- `row_access_policies` field now organizes output of show under `show_output` field and the output of describe under `describe_output` field.

Please adjust your Terraform configuration files.

### snowflake_row_access_policy resource changes
New fields:
  - `show_output` field that holds the response from SHOW ROW ACCESS POLICIES.
  - `describe_output` field that holds the response from DESCRIBE ROW ACCESS POLICY.

#### *(breaking change)* Renamed fields in snowflake_row_access_policy resource
Renamed fields:
  - `row_access_expression` to `body`
Please rename these fields in your configuration files. State will be migrated automatically.

#### *(breaking change)* Adjusted schema of arguments/signature
The field `signature` is renamed to `arguments` to be consistent with other resources.
Now, arguments are stored as a list, instead of a map. Please adjust that in your configs. State is migrated automatically. Also, this means that order of the items matters and may be adjusted.


The old configuration looks like this:
```
  signature = {
    A = "VARCHAR",
    B = "VARCHAR"
  }
```

The new configuration looks like this:
```
  argument {
    name = "A"
    type = "VARCHAR"
  }
  argument {
    name = "B"
    type = "VARCHAR"
  }
```

Argument names are now case sensitive. All policies created previously in the provider have upper case argument names. If you used lower case before, please adjust your configs. Values in the state will be migrated to uppercase automatically.

#### *(breaking change)* Adjusted behavior on changing name
Previously, after changing `name` field, the resource was recreated. Now, the object is renamed with `RENAME TO`.

#### *(breaking change)* Mitigating permadiff on `body`
Previously, `body` of a policy was compared as a raw string. This led to permanent diff because of leading newlines (see https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/2053).

Now, similarly to handling statements in other resources, we replace blank characters with a space. The provider can cause false positives in cases where a change in case or run of whitespace is semantically significant.

#### *(breaking change)* Identifiers related changes
During [identifiers rework](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/ROADMAP.md#identifiers-rework) we decided to
migrate resource ids from pipe-separated to regular Snowflake identifiers (e.g. `<database_name>|<schema_name>` -> `"<database_name>"."<schema_name>"`). Importing resources also needs to be adjusted (see [example](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/row_access_policy#import)).

Also, we added diff suppress function that prevents Terraform from showing differences, when only quoting is different.

No change is required, the state will be migrated automatically.

## v0.94.x ➞ v0.95.0

### *(breaking change)* database roles data source; field rename, schema structure changes, and adding missing filtering options

- `database` renamed to `in_database`
- Added `like` and `limit` filtering options
- `SHOW DATABASE ROLES` output is now put inside `database_roles.*.show_output`. Here's the list of currently available fields:
    - `created_on`
    - `name`
    - `is_default`
    - `is_current`
    - `is_inherited`
    - `granted_to_roles`
    - `granted_to_database_roles`
    - `granted_database_roles`
    - `owner`
    - `comment`
    - `owner_role_type`

### snowflake_views data source changes
New filtering options:
- `in`
- `like`
- `starts_with`
- `limit`
- `with_describe`

New output fields
- `show_output`
- `describe_output`

Breaking changes:
- `database` and `schema` are right now under `in` field
- `views` field now organizes output of show under `show_output` field and the output of describe under `describe_output` field.

### snowflake_view resource changes
New fields:
  - `row_access_policy`
  - `aggregation_policy`
  - `change_tracking`
  - `is_recursive`
  - `is_temporary`
  - `data_metric_schedule`
  - `data_metric_function`
  - `column`
- added `show_output` field that holds the response from SHOW VIEWS.
- added `describe_output` field that holds the response from DESCRIBE VIEW. Note that one needs to grant sufficient privileges e.g. with [grant_ownership](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/grant_ownership) on the tables used in this view. Otherwise, this field is not filled.

#### *(breaking change)* Removed fields from snowflake_view resource
Removed fields:
- `or_replace` - `OR REPLACE` is added by the provider automatically when `copy_grants` is set to `"true"`
- `tag` - Please, use [tag_association](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/tag_association) instead.
The value of these field will be removed from the state automatically.

#### *(breaking change)* Required warehouse
For this resource, the provider now uses [policy references](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/policy_references) which requires a warehouse in the connection. Please, make sure you have either set a `DEFAULT_WAREHOUSE` for the user, or specified a warehouse in the provider configuration.

### Identifier changes

#### *(breaking change)* resource identifiers for schema and streamlit
During [identifiers rework](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/ROADMAP.md#identifiers-rework) we decided to
migrate resource ids from pipe-separated to regular Snowflake identifiers (e.g. `<database_name>|<schema_name>` -> `"<database_name>"."<schema_name>"`).
Exception to that rule will be identifiers that consist of multiple parts (like in the case of [grant_privileges_to_account_role](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/grant_privileges_to_account_role#import)'s resource id).
The change was applied to already refactored resources (only in the case of `snowflake_schema` and `snowflake_streamlit` this will be a breaking change, because the rest of the objects are single part identifiers in the format of `<name>`):
- `snowflake_api_authentication_integration_with_authorization_code_grant`
- `snowflake_api_authentication_integration_with_client_credentials`
- `snowflake_api_authentication_integration_with_jwt_bearer`
- `snowflake_oauth_integration_for_custom_clients`
- `snowflake_oauth_integration_for_partner_applications`
- `snowflake_external_oauth_integration`
- `snowflake_saml2_integration`
- `snowflake_scim_integration`
- `snowflake_database`
- `snowflake_shared_database`
- `snowflake_secondary_database`
- `snowflake_account_role`
- `snowflake_network_policy`
- `snowflake_warehouse`

No change is required, the state will be migrated automatically.
The rest of the objects will be changed when working on them during [v1 object preparations](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/ROADMAP.md#preparing-essential-ga-objects-for-the-provider-v1).

#### *(breaking change)* diff suppress for identifier quoting
(The same set of resources listed above was adjusted)
To prevent issues like [this one](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/2982), we added diff suppress function that prevents Terraform from showing differences,
when only quoting is different. In some cases, Snowflake output (mostly from SHOW commands) was dictating which field should be additionally quoted and which shouldn't, but that should no longer be the case.
Like in the change above, the rest of the objects will be changed when working on them during [v1 object preparations](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/ROADMAP.md#preparing-essential-ga-objects-for-the-provider-v1).

### New `fully_qualified_name` field in the resources.
We added a new `fully_qualified_name` to snowflake resources. This should help with referencing other resources in fields that expect a fully qualified name. For example, instead of
writing

```object_name = “\”${snowflake_table.database}\”.\”${snowflake_table.schema}\”.\”${snowflake_table.name}\””```

 now we can write

```object_name = snowflake_table.fully_qualified_name```

See more details in [identifiers guide](./docs/guides/identifiers.md#new-computed-fully-qualified-name-field-in-resources).

See [example usage](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/grant_privileges_to_account_role).

Some of the resources are excluded from this change:
- deprecated resources
  - `snowflake_database_old`
  - `snowflake_oauth_integration`
  - `snowflake_saml_integration`
- resources for which fully qualified name is not appropriate
  - `snowflake_account_parameter`
  - `snowflake_account_password_policy_attachment`
  - `snowflake_network_policy_attachment`
  - `snowflake_session_parameter`
  - `snowflake_table_constraint`
  - `snowflake_table_column_masking_policy_application`
  - `snowflake_tag_masking_policy_association`
  - `snowflake_tag_association`
  - `snowflake_user_password_policy_attachment`
  - `snowflake_user_public_keys`
  - grant resources

#### *(breaking change)* removed `qualified_name` from `snowflake_masking_policy`, `snowflake_network_rule`, `snowflake_password_policy` and `snowflake_table`
Because of introducing a new `fully_qualified_name` field for all of the resources, `qualified_name` was removed from `snowflake_masking_policy`, `snowflake_network_rule`,  `snowflake_password_policy` and `snowflake_table`. Please adjust your configurations. State is automatically migrated.

### snowflake_stage resource changes

#### *(bugfix)* Correctly handle renamed/deleted stage

Correctly handle the situation when stage was rename/deleted externally (earlier it resulted in a permanent loop). No action is required on the user's side.

Connected issues: [#2972](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/2972)

### snowflake_table resource changes

#### *(bugfix)* Handle data type diff suppression better for text and number

Data types are not entirely correctly handled inside the provider (read more e.g. in [#2735](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/2735)). It will be still improved with the upcoming function, procedure, and table rework. Currently, diff suppression was fixed for text and number data types in the table resource with the following assumptions/limitations:
- for numbers the default precision is 38 and the default scale is 0 (following the [docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/data-types-numeric#number))
- for number types the following types are treated as synonyms: `NUMBER`, `DECIMAL`, `NUMERIC`, `INT`, `INTEGER`, `BIGINT`, `SMALLINT`, `TINYINT`, `BYTEINT`
- for text the default length is 16777216 (following the [docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/data-types-text#varchar))
- for text types the following types are treated as synonyms: `VARCHAR`, `CHAR`, `CHARACTER`, `STRING`, `TEXT`
- whitespace and casing is ignored
- if the type arguments cannot be parsed the defaults are used and therefore diff may be suppressed unexpectedly (please report such cases)

No action is required on the user's side.

Connected issues: [#3007](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/3007)

### snowflake_user resource changes

Because of the multiple changes in the resource, the easiest migration way is to follow our [migration guide](./docs/guides/resource_migration.md) to perform zero downtime migration. Alternatively, it is possible to follow some pointers below. Either way, familiarize yourself with the resource changes before version bumping. Also, check the [design decisions](./v1-preparations/CHANGES_BEFORE_V1.md).

#### *(breaking change)* user parameters added to snowflake_user resource

On our road to V1 we changed the approach to Snowflake parameters on the object level; now, we add them directly to the resource. This is a **breaking change** because now:
- Leaving the config empty does not set the default value on the object level but uses the one from hierarchy on Snowflake level instead (so after version bump, the diff running `UNSET` statements is expected).
- This change is not compatible with `snowflake_object_parameter` - you have to set the parameter inside `snowflake_user` resource **IF** you manage users through terraform **AND** you want to set the parameter on the user level.

For more details, check the [Snowflake parameters](./v1-preparations/CHANGES_BEFORE_V1.md#snowflake-parameters).

The following set of [parameters](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/parameters) was added to the `snowflake_user` resource:

#### *(breaking change)* Changes in sensitiveness of name, login_name, and display_name

According to https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/all_user_names#usage-notes, `NAME`s are not considered sensitive data and `LOGIN_NAME`s are. Previous versions of the provider had this the other way around. In this version, `name` attribute was unmarked as sensitive, whereas `login_name` was marked as sensitive. This may break your configuration if you were using `login_name`s before e.g. in a `for_each` loop.

The `display_name` attribute was marked as sensitive. It defaults to `name` if not provided on Snowflake side. Because `name` is no longer sensitive, we also change the setting for the `display_name`.

Connected issues: [#2662](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/2662), [#2668](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/2668).

#### *(bugfix)* Correctly handle `default_warehouse`, `default_namespace`, and `default_role`

During the [identifiers rework](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/ROADMAP.md#identifiers-rework), we generalized how we compute the differences correctly for the identifier fields (read more in [this document](./docs/guides/identifiers_rework_design_decisions.md)). Proper suppressor was applied to `default_warehouse`, `default_namespace`, and `default_role`. Also, all these three attributes were corrected (e.g. handling spaces/hyphens in names).

Connected issues: [#2836](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/pull/2836), [#2942](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/2942)

#### *(bugfix)* Correctly handle failed update

Not every attribute can be updated in the state during read (like `password` in the `snowflake_user` resource). In situations where update fails, we may end up with an incorrect state (read more in https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/issues/476). We use a deprecated method from the plugin SDK, and now, for partially failed updates, we preserve the resource's previous state. It fixed this kind of situations for `snowflake_user` resource.

Connected issues: [#2970](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/pull/2970)

#### *(breaking change)* Handling default secondary roles

Old field `default_secondary_roles` was removed in favour of the new, easier, `default_secondary_roles_option` because the only possible options that can be currently set are `('ALL')` and `()`.  The logic to handle set element changes was convoluted and error-prone. Additionally, [bcr 2024_07](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/bcr-bundles/2024_07/bcr-1692) complicated the matter even more.

Now:
- the default value is `DEFAULT` - it falls back to Snowflake default (so `()` before and `('ALL')` after the BCR)
- to explicitly set to `('ALL')` use `ALL`
- to explicitly set to `()` use `NONE`

While migrating, the old `default_secondary_roles` will be removed from the state automatically and `default_secondary_roles_option` will be constructed based on the previous value (in some cases apply may be necessary).

Connected issues: [#3038](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/pull/3038)

#### *(breaking change)* Attributes changes

Attributes that are no longer computed:
- `login_name`
- `display_name`
- `disabled`
- `default_role`

New fields:
- `middle_name`
- `days_to_expiry`
- `mins_to_unlock`
- `mins_to_bypass_mfa`
- `disable_mfa`
- `default_secondary_roles_option`
- `show_output` - holds the response from `SHOW USERS`. Remember that the field will be only recomputed if one of the user attributes is changed.
- `parameters` - holds the response from `SHOW PARAMETERS IN USER`.

Removed fields:
- `has_rsa_public_key`
- `default_secondary_roles` - replaced with `default_secondary_roles_option`

Default changes:
- `must_change_password`
- `disabled`

Type changes:
- `must_change_password`: bool -> string (To easily handle three-value logic (true, false, unknown) in provider's configs, read more in https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/751239b7d2fee4757471db6c03b952d4728ee099/v1-preparations/CHANGES_BEFORE_V1.md?plain=1#L24)
- `disabled`: bool -> string (To easily handle three-value logic (true, false, unknown) in provider's configs, read more in https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/751239b7d2fee4757471db6c03b952d4728ee099/v1-preparations/CHANGES_BEFORE_V1.md?plain=1#L24)

#### *(breaking change)* refactored snowflake_users datasource
> **IMPORTANT NOTE:** when querying users you don't have permissions to, the querying options are limited.
You won't get almost any field in `show_output` (only empty or default values), the DESCRIBE command will return error when called, so you have to set `with_describe = false`; the SHOW PARAMETERS command will return error if called too, so you have to set `with_parameters = false`.

Changes:
- account checking logic was entirely removed
- `pattern` renamed to `like`
- `like`, `starts_with`, and `limit` filters added
- `SHOW USERS` output is enclosed in `show_output` field inside `users` (all the previous fields in `users` map were removed)
- Added outputs from **DESC USER** and **SHOW PARAMETERS IN USER** (they can be turned off by declaring `with_describe = false` and `with_parameters = false`, **they're turned on by default**).
  The additional parameters call **DESC USER** (with `with_describe` turned on) and **SHOW PARAMETERS IN USER** (with `with_parameters` turned on) **per user** returned by **SHOW USERS**.
  The outputs of both commands are held in `users` entry, where **DESC USER** is saved in the `describe_output` field, and **SHOW PARAMETERS IN USER** in the `parameters` field.
  It's important to limit the records and calls to Snowflake to the minimum. That's why we recommend assessing which information you need from the data source and then providing strong filters and turning off additional fields for better plan performance.

Connected issues: [#2902](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/pull/2902)

#### *(breaking change)* snowflake_user_public_keys usage with snowflake_user

`snowflake_user_public_keys` is a resource allowing to set keys for the given user. Before this version, it was possible to have `snowflake_user` and `snowflake_user_public_keys` used next to each other.
Because the logic handling the keys in `snowflake_user` was fixed, it is advised to use `snowflake_user_public_keys` only when user is not managed through terraform. Having both resources configured for the same user will result in improper behavior.

To migrate, in case of having two resources:
- copy the keys to `rsa_public_key` and `rsa_public_key2` in `snowflake_user`
- remove `snowflake_user_public_keys` from state (following [Resource migration guide](./docs/guides/resource_migration.md#resource-migration))
- remove `snowflake_user_public_keys` from config

#### *(breaking change)* snowflake_network_policy_attachment usage with snowflake_user

`snowflake_network_policy_attachment` changes are similar to the changes to `snowflake_user_public_keys` above. It is advised to use `snowflake_network_policy_attachment` only when user is not managed through terraform. Having both resources configured for the same user will result in improper behavior.

To migrate, in case of having two resources:
- copy network policy to [network_policy](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/0.95.0/docs/resources/user#network_policy) attribute in the `snowflake_user` resource
- remove `snowflake_network_policy_attachment` from state (following [Resource migration guide](./docs/guides/resource_migration.md#resource-migration))
- remove `snowflake_network_policy_attachment` from config

References: [#3048](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/discussions/3048), [#3058](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/3058)

#### *(note)* snowflake_user_password_policy_attachment and other user policies

`snowflake_user_password_policy_attachment` is not addressed in the current version.
Attaching other user policies is not addressed in the current version.

Both topics will be addressed in the following versions.

#### *(note)* user types

`service` and `legacy_service` user types are currently not supported. They will be supported in the following versions as separate resources (namely `snowflake_service_user` and `snowflake_legacy_service_user`).

If you used the existing `snowflake_user` and altered its type externally (manually or through `snowflake_unsafe_execute`), then after migrating to v0.95.0 the provider will try to recreate it as a `person` type.

Because `snowflake_service_user` and `snowflake_legacy_service_user` resources are available in v0.97.0 version, you can temporarily suppress these changes to allow version-by-version migration. To do that, use [`ignore_changes`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle#ignore_changes) meta-attribute:

```hcl
resource "snowflake_user" "example_user" {
  # ...
  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [ user_type ]
  }
}
```

## v0.94.0 ➞ v0.94.1
### changes in snowflake_schema

In order to avoid dropping `PUBLIC` schemas, we have decided to use `ALTER` instead of `OR REPLACE` during creation. In the future we are planning to use `CREATE OR ALTER` when it becomes available for schemas.

## v0.93.0 ➞ v0.94.0
### *(breaking change)* changes in snowflake_scim_integration

In order to fix issues in v0.93.0, when a resource has Azure scim client, `sync_password` field is now set to `default` value in the state. State will be migrated automatically.

### *(breaking change)* refactored snowflake_schema resource

Renamed fields:
- renamed `is_managed` to `with_managed_access`
- renamed `data_retention_days` to `data_retention_time_in_days`

Please rename these fields in your configuration files. State will be migrated automatically.

Removed fields:
- `tag`
The value of this field will be removed from the state automatically. Please, use [tag_association](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/tag_association) instead.

New fields:
- the following set of [parameters](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/parameters) was added:
    - `max_data_extension_time_in_days`
    - `external_volume`
    - `catalog`
    - `replace_invalid_characters`
    - `default_ddl_collation`
    - `storage_serialization_policy`
    - `log_level`
    - `trace_level`
    - `suspend_task_after_num_failures`
    - `task_auto_retry_attempts`
    - `user_task_managed_initial_warehouse_size`
    - `user_task_timeout_ms`
    - `user_task_minimum_trigger_interval_in_seconds`
    - `quoted_identifiers_ignore_case`
    - `enable_console_output`
    - `pipe_execution_paused`
- added `show_output` field that holds the response from SHOW SCHEMAS.
- added `describe_output` field that holds the response from DESCRIBE SCHEMA. Note that one needs to grant sufficient privileges e.g. with [grant_ownership](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/grant_ownership) on all objects in the schema. Otherwise, this field is not filled.
- added `parameters` field that holds the response from SHOW PARAMETERS IN SCHEMA.

We allow creating and managing `PUBLIC` schemas now. When the name of the schema is `PUBLIC`, it's created with `OR_REPLACE`. Please be careful with this operation, because you may experience data loss. `OR_REPLACE` does `DROP` before `CREATE`, so all objects in the schema will be dropped and this is not visible in Terraform plan. To restore data-related objects that might have been accidentally or intentionally deleted, pleas read about [Time Travel](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-time-travel). The alternative is to import `PUBLIC` schema manually and then manage it with Terraform. We've decided this based on [#2826](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/2826).

#### *(behavior change)* Boolean type changes
To easily handle three-value logic (true, false, unknown) in provider's configs, type of `is_transient` and `with_managed_access` was changed from boolean to string.

Terraform should recreate resources for configs lacking `is_transient` (`DROP` and then `CREATE` will be run underneath). To prevent this behavior, please set the `is_transient` field to the desired value (`"true"` for transient schemas, `"false"` for non-transient ones).
For more details about default values, please refer to the [changes before v1](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/v1-preparations/CHANGES_BEFORE_V1.md#default-values) document.

Terraform should perform an action for configs lacking `with_managed_access` (`ALTER SCHEMA DISABLE MANAGED ACCESS` will be run underneath which should not affect the Snowflake object, because `MANAGED ACCESS` is not set by default)
### *(breaking change)* refactored snowflake_schemas datasource
Changes:
- `database` is removed and can be specified inside `in` field.
- `like`, `in`, `starts_with`, and `limit` fields enable filtering.
- SHOW SCHEMAS output is enclosed in `show_output` field inside `schemas`.
- Added outputs from **DESC SCHEMA** and **SHOW PARAMETERS IN SCHEMA** (they can be turned off by declaring `with_describe = false` and `with_parameters = false`, **they're turned on by default**).
  The additional parameters call **DESC SCHEMA** (with `with_describe` turned on) and **SHOW PARAMETERS IN SCHEMA** (with `with_parameters` turned on) **per schema** returned by **SHOW SCHEMAS**.
  The outputs of both commands are held in `schemas` entry, where **DESC SCHEMA** is saved in the `describe_output` field, and **SHOW PARAMETERS IN SCHEMA** in the `parameters` field.
  It's important to limit the records and calls to Snowflake to the minimum. That's why we recommend assessing which information you need from the data source and then providing strong filters and turning off additional fields for better plan performance.

### *(new feature)* new snowflake_account_role resource

Already existing `snowflake_role` was deprecated in favor of the new `snowflake_account_role`. The old resource got upgraded to
have the same features as the new one. The only difference is the deprecation message on the old resource.

New fields:
- added `show_output` field that holds the response from SHOW ROLES. Remember that the field will be only recomputed if one of the fields (`name` or `comment`) are changed.

### *(breaking change)* refactored snowflake_roles data source

Changes:
- New `in_class` filtering option to filter out roles by class name, e.g. `in_class = "SNOWFLAKE.CORE.BUDGET"`
- `pattern` was renamed to `like`
- output of SHOW is enclosed in `show_output`, so before, e.g. `roles.0.comment` is now `roles.0.show_output.0.comment`

### *(new feature)* snowflake_streamlit resource
Added a new resource for managing streamlits. See reference [docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-streamlit). In this resource, we decided to split `ROOT_LOCATION` in Snowflake to two fields: `stage` representing stage fully qualified name and `directory_location` containing a path within this stage to root location.

### *(new feature)* snowflake_streamlits datasource
Added a new datasource enabling querying and filtering streamlits. Notes:
- all results are stored in `streamlits` field.
- `like`, `in`, and `limit` fields enable streamlits filtering.
- SHOW STREAMLITS output is enclosed in `show_output` field inside `streamlits`.
- Output from **DESC STREAMLIT** (which can be turned off by declaring `with_describe = false`, **it's turned on by default**) is enclosed in `describe_output` field inside `streamlits`.
  The additional parameters call **DESC STREAMLIT** (with `with_describe` turned on) **per streamlit** returned by **SHOW STREAMLITS**.
  It's important to limit the records and calls to Snowflake to the minimum. That's why we recommend assessing which information you need from the data source and then providing strong filters and turning off additional fields for better plan performance.

### *(new feature)* refactored snowflake_network_policy resource

No migration required.

New behavior:
- `name` is no longer marked as ForceNew parameter. When changed, now it will perform ALTER RENAME operation, instead of re-creating with the new name.
- Additional validation was added to `blocked_ip_list` to inform about specifying `0.0.0.0/0` ip. More details in the [official documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-network-policy#usage-notes).

New fields:
- `show_output` and `describe_output` added to hold the results returned by `SHOW` and `DESCRIBE` commands. Those fields will only be recomputed when specified fields change

### *(new feature)* snowflake_network_policies datasource

Added a new datasource enabling querying and filtering network policies. Notes:
- all results are stored in `network_policies` field.
- `like` field enables filtering.
- SHOW NETWORK POLICIES output is enclosed in `show_output` field inside `network_policies`.
- Output from **DESC NETWORK POLICY** (which can be turned off by declaring `with_describe = false`, **it's turned on by default**) is enclosed in `describe_output` field inside `network_policies`.
  The additional parameters call **DESC NETWORK POLICY** (with `with_describe` turned on) **per network policy** returned by **SHOW NETWORK POLICIES**.
  It's important to limit the records and calls to Snowflake to the minimum. That's why we recommend assessing which information you need from the data source and then providing strong filters and turning off additional fields for better plan performance.

### *(fix)* snowflake_warehouse resource

Because of the issue [#2948](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/2948), we are relaxing the validations for the Snowflake parameter values. Read more in [CHANGES_BEFORE_V1.md](v1-preparations/CHANGES_BEFORE_V1.md#validations).

## v0.92.0 ➞ v0.93.0

### general changes

With this change we introduce the first resources redesigned for the V1. We have made a few design choices that will be reflected in these and in the further reworked resources. This includes:
- Handling the [default values](./v1-preparations/CHANGES_BEFORE_V1.md#default-values).
- Handling the ["empty" values](./v1-preparations/CHANGES_BEFORE_V1.md#empty-values).
- Handling the [Snowflake parameters](./v1-preparations/CHANGES_BEFORE_V1.md#snowflake-parameters).
- Saving the [config values in the state](./v1-preparations/CHANGES_BEFORE_V1.md#config-values-in-the-state).
- Providing a ["raw Snowflake output"](./v1-preparations/CHANGES_BEFORE_V1.md#empty-values) for the managed resources.

They are all described in short in the [changes before v1 doc](./v1-preparations/CHANGES_BEFORE_V1.md). Please familiarize yourself with these changes before the upgrade.

### old grant resources removal
Following the [announcement](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/discussions/2736) we have removed the old grant resources.
The two resources [snowflake_role_ownership_grant](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/role_ownership_grant) and
[snowflake_user_ownership_grant](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/user_ownership_grant) were not listed in the announcement,
but they were also marked as deprecated ones. We are removing them too to conclude the grants redesign saga.

#### Grant resource mappings
As previous resources had multiple responsibilities within a single entity, we opted to divide them into more specialized resources.
Because of that, they (mostly) cannot be mapped one to one. To migrate the old grant resources to the new ones, use the following mapping rules:
- If you are using `shares` field, use the [snowflake_grant_privileges_to_share](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/grant_privileges_to_share) resource.
- If you are using `roles` field, use the [snowflake_grant_privileges_to_account_role](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/grant_privileges_to_account_role) resource.
- For OWNERSHIP privilege manipulation, use the dedicated [snowflake_grant_ownership](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/grant_ownership) resource.
- New grant resources expect fully qualified identifiers (e.g., [grant_privileges_to_account_role](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/grant_privileges_to_account_role#object_name-2) with `object_name`), instead of parts of identifier split between few fields (e.g., [function_grant](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/0.90.0/docs/resources/function_grant#database_name-8) with `database_name`, `schema_name`, `function_name`, and `argument_data_types`). Use `fully_qualified_name` field whenever possible to avoid identifier issues (look [here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/guides/identifiers_rework_design_decisions#new-computed-fully-qualified-name-field-in-resources)).
- The `enable_masking_grants` field that could be found, for example, in [masking_policy_grant](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/0.90.0/docs/resources/masking_policy_grant) resource is now "enabled by default" for all new grant resources. In the new resources, there's no way to disable this setting. We left it as a [future topic](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/guides/grants_redesign_design_decisions#future-topics) if such need arises.
- The `on_all` and `on_future` fields were transformed from [boolean type](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/0.90.0/docs/resources/schema_grant#on_all-9) to [nested object](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/0.90.0/docs/resources/schema_grant#on_all-9). Now, it reflects more the [GRANT PRIVILEGE](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/grant-privilege) documentation.
- The `revert_ownership_to_role_name` option that was available in the [user_ownership_grant](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/0.90.0/docs/resources/user_ownership_grant#revert_ownership_to_role_name-24) is not supported in the new [grant_ownership](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/grant_ownership) resource, but [we have it in our plans](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/latest/docs/guides/grant_ownership_resource_overview#future-plans) as an improvement.

> Because new resources are more general and promote single responsibility, you may end up with higher resource count than before (at least "under the hood," because new resources are easier to work with `for_each` can be easily generated for different configurations).
> We plan to improve this topic in the future, as it is a highly requested feature (mostly because resource count is usually a measure used for billing).

### *(new feature)* Api authentication resources
Added new api authentication resources, i.e.:
- `snowflake_api_authentication_integration_with_authorization_code_grant`
- `snowflake_api_authentication_integration_with_client_credentials`
- `snowflake_api_authentication_integration_with_jwt_bearer`

See reference [doc](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-security-integration-api-auth).

### *(new feature)* snowflake_oauth_integration_for_custom_clients and snowflake_oauth_integration_for_partner_applications resources

To enhance clarity and functionality, the new resources `snowflake_oauth_integration_for_custom_clients` and `snowflake_oauth_integration_for_partner_applications` have been introduced
to replace the previous `snowflake_oauth_integration`. Recognizing that the old resource carried multiple responsibilities within a single entity, we opted to divide it into two more specialized resources.
The newly introduced resources are aligned with the latest Snowflake documentation at the time of implementation, and adhere to our [new conventions](#general-changes).
This segregation was based on the `oauth_client` attribute, where `CUSTOM` corresponds to `snowflake_oauth_integration_for_custom_clients`,
while other attributes align with `snowflake_oauth_integration_for_partner_applications`.

### *(new feature)* snowflake_security_integrations datasource
Added a new datasource enabling querying and filtering all types of security integrations. Notes:
- all results are stored in `security_integrations` field.
- `like` field enables security integrations filtering.
- SHOW SECURITY INTEGRATIONS output is enclosed in `show_output` field inside `security_integrations`.
- Output from **DESC SECURITY INTEGRATION** (which can be turned off by declaring `with_describe = false`, **it's turned on by default**) is enclosed in `describe_output` field inside `security_integrations`.
  **DESC SECURITY INTEGRATION** returns different properties based on the integration type. Consult the documentation to check which ones will be filled for which integration.
  The additional parameters call **DESC SECURITY INTEGRATION** (with `with_describe` turned on) **per security integration** returned by **SHOW SECURITY INTEGRATIONS**.
  It's important to limit the records and calls to Snowflake to the minimum. That's why we recommend assessing which information you need from the data source and then providing strong filters and turning off additional fields for better plan performance.

### snowflake_external_oauth_integration resource changes

#### *(behavior change)* Renamed fields
Renamed fields:
- `type` to `external_oauth_type`
- `issuer` to `external_oauth_issuer`
- `token_user_mapping_claims` to `external_oauth_token_user_mapping_claim`
- `snowflake_user_mapping_attribute` to `external_oauth_snowflake_user_mapping_attribute`
- `scope_mapping_attribute` to `external_oauth_scope_mapping_attribute`
- `jws_keys_urls` to `external_oauth_jws_keys_url`
- `rsa_public_key` to `external_oauth_rsa_public_key`
- `rsa_public_key_2` to `external_oauth_rsa_public_key_2`
- `blocked_roles` to `external_oauth_blocked_roles_list`
- `allowed_roles` to `external_oauth_allowed_roles_list`
- `audience_urls` to `external_oauth_audience_list`
- `any_role_mode` to `external_oauth_any_role_mode`
- `scope_delimiter` to `external_oauth_scope_delimiter`
to align with Snowflake docs. Please rename this field in your configuration files. State will be migrated automatically.

#### *(behavior change)* Force new for multiple attributes after removing from config
Conditional force new was added for the following attributes when they are removed from config. There are no alter statements supporting UNSET on these fields.
- `external_oauth_rsa_public_key`
- `external_oauth_rsa_public_key_2`
- `external_oauth_scope_mapping_attribute`
- `external_oauth_jws_keys_url`
- `external_oauth_token_user_mapping_claim`

#### *(behavior change)* Conflicting fields
Fields listed below can not be set at the same time in Snowflake. They are marked as conflicting fields.
- `external_oauth_jws_keys_url` <-> `external_oauth_rsa_public_key`
- `external_oauth_jws_keys_url` <-> `external_oauth_rsa_public_key_2`
- `external_oauth_allowed_roles_list` <-> `external_oauth_blocked_roles_list`

#### *(behavior change)* Changed diff suppress for some fields
The fields listed below had diff suppress which removed '-' from strings. Now, this behavior is removed, so if you had '-' in these strings, please remove them. Note that '-' in these values is not allowed by Snowflake.
- `external_oauth_snowflake_user_mapping_attribute`
- `external_oauth_type`
- `external_oauth_any_role_mode`

### *(new feature)* snowflake_saml2_integration resource

The new `snowflake_saml2_integration` is introduced and deprecates `snowflake_saml_integration`. It contains new fields
and follows our new conventions making it more stable. The old SAML integration wasn't changed, so no migration needed,
but we recommend to eventually migrate to the newer counterpart.

### snowflake_scim_integration resource changes
#### *(behavior change)* Changed behavior of `sync_password`

Now, the `sync_password` field will set the state value to `default` whenever the value is not set in the config. This indicates that the value on the Snowflake side is set to the Snowflake default.

> [!WARNING]
> This change causes issues for Azure scim client (see [#2946](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/2946)). The workaround is to remove the resource from the state with `terraform state rm`, add `sync_password = true` to the config, and import with `terraform import "snowflake_scim_integration.test" "aad_provisioning"`. After these steps, there should be no errors and no diff on this field. This behavior is fixed in v0.94 with state upgrader.


#### *(behavior change)* Renamed fields

Renamed field `provisioner_role` to `run_as_role` to align with Snowflake docs. Please rename this field in your configuration files. State will be migrated automatically.

#### *(new feature)* New fields
Fields added to the resource:
- `enabled`
- `sync_password`
- `comment`

#### *(behavior change)* Changed behavior of `enabled`
New field `enabled` is required. Previously the default value during create in Snowflake was `true`. If you created a resource with Terraform, please add `enabled = true` to have the same value.

#### *(behavior change)* Force new for multiple attributes
ForceNew was added for the following attributes (because there are no usable SQL alter statements for them):
- `scim_client`
- `run_as_role`

### snowflake_warehouse resource changes

Because of the multiple changes in the resource, the easiest migration way is to follow our [migration guide](./docs/guides/resource_migration.md) to perform zero downtime migration. Alternatively, it is possible to follow some pointers below. Either way, familiarize yourself with the resource changes before version bumping. Also, check the [design decisions](./v1-preparations/CHANGES_BEFORE_V1.md).

#### *(potential behavior change)* Default values removed
As part of the [redesign](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/ROADMAP.md#preparing-essential-ga-objects-for-the-provider-v1) we are removing the default values for attributes having their defaults on Snowflake side to reduce coupling with the provider (read more in [default values](./v1-preparations/CHANGES_BEFORE_V1.md#default-values)). Because of that the following defaults were removed:
- `comment` (previously `""`)
- `enable_query_acceleration` (previously `false`)
- `query_acceleration_max_scale_factor` (previously `8`)
- `warehouse_type` (previously `"STANDARD"`)
- `max_concurrency_level` (previously `8`)
- `statement_queued_timeout_in_seconds` (previously `0`)
- `statement_timeout_in_seconds` (previously `172800`)

**Beware!** For attributes being Snowflake parameters (in case of warehouse: `max_concurrency_level`, `statement_queued_timeout_in_seconds`, and `statement_timeout_in_seconds`), this is a breaking change (read more in [Snowflake parameters](./v1-preparations/CHANGES_BEFORE_V1.md#snowflake-parameters)). Previously, not setting a value for them was treated as a fallback to values hardcoded on the provider side. This caused warehouse creation with these parameters set on the warehouse level (and not using the Snowflake default from hierarchy; read more in the [parameters documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/parameters)). To keep the previous values, fill in your configs to the default values listed above.

All previous defaults were aligned with the current Snowflake ones, however it's not possible to distinguish between filled out value and no value in the automatic state upgrader. Therefore, if the given attribute is not filled out in your configuration, terraform will try to perform update after the change (to UNSET the given attribute to the Snowflake default); it should result in no changes on Snowflake object side, but it is required to make Terraform state aligned with your config. **All** other optional fields that were not set inside the config at all (because of the change in handling state logic on our provider side) will follow the same logic. To avoid the need for the changes, fill out the default fields in your config. Alternatively, run `terraform apply`; no further changes should be shown as a part of the plan.

#### *(note)* Automatic state migrations
There are three migrations that should happen automatically with the version bump:
- incorrect `2XLARGE`, `3XLARGE`, `4XLARGE`, `5XLARGE`, `6XLARGE` values for warehouse size are changed to the proper ones
- deprecated `wait_for_provisioning` attribute is removed from the state
- old empty resource monitor attribute is cleaned (earlier it was set to `"null"` string)

#### *(fix)* Warehouse size UNSET

Before the changes, removing warehouse size from the config was not handled properly. Because UNSET is not supported for warehouse size (check the [docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/alter-warehouse#properties-parameters) - usage notes for unset) and there are multiple defaults possible, removing the size from config will result in the resource recreation.

#### *(behavior change)* Validation changes
As part of the [redesign](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/ROADMAP.md#preparing-essential-ga-objects-for-the-provider-v1) we are adjusting validations or removing them to reduce coupling between Snowflake and the provider. Because of that the following validations were removed/adjusted/added:
- `max_cluster_count` - adjusted: added higher bound (10) according to Snowflake docs
- `min_cluster_count` - adjusted: added higher bound (10) according to Snowflake docs
- `auto_suspend` - adjusted: added `0` as valid value
- `warehouse_size` - adjusted: removed incorrect `2XLARGE`, `3XLARGE`, `4XLARGE`, `5XLARGE`, `6XLARGE` values
- `resource_monitor` - added: validation for a valid identifier (still subject to change during [identifiers rework](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/ROADMAP.md#identifiers-rework))
- `max_concurrency_level` - added: validation according to MAX_CONCURRENCY_LEVEL parameter docs
- `statement_queued_timeout_in_seconds` - added: validation according to STATEMENT_QUEUED_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS parameter docs
- `statement_timeout_in_seconds` - added: validation according to STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS parameter docs

#### *(behavior change)* Deprecated `wait_for_provisioning` field removed
`wait_for_provisioning` field was deprecated a long time ago. It's high time it was removed from the schema.

#### *(behavior change)* `query_acceleration_max_scale_factor` conditional logic removed
Previously, the `query_acceleration_max_scale_factor` was depending on `enable_query_acceleration` parameter, but it is not required on Snowflake side. After migration, `terraform plan` should suggest changes if `enable_query_acceleration` was earlier set to false (manually or from default) and if `query_acceleration_max_scale_factor` was set in config.

#### *(behavior change)* `initially_suspended` forceNew removed
Previously, the `initially_suspended` attribute change caused the resource recreation. This attribute is used only during creation (to create suspended warehouse). There is no reason to recreate the whole object just to have initial state changed.

#### *(behavior change)* Boolean type changes
To easily handle three-value logic (true, false, unknown) in provider's configs, type of `auto_resume` and `enable_query_acceleration` was changed from boolean to string. This should not require updating existing configs (boolean/int value should be accepted and state will be migrated to string automatically), however we recommend changing config values to strings. Terraform should perform an action for configs lacking `auto_resume` or `enable_query_acceleration` (`ALTER WAREHOUSE UNSET AUTO_RESUME` and/or `ALTER WAREHOUSE UNSET ENABLE_QUERY_ACCELERATION` will be run underneath which should not affect the Snowflake object, because `auto_resume` and `enable_query_acceleration` are false by default).

#### *(note)* `resource_monitor` validation and diff suppression
`resource_monitor` is an identifier and handling logic may be still slightly changed as part of https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/ROADMAP.md#identifiers-rework. It should be handled automatically (without needed manual actions on user side), though, but it is not guaranteed.

#### *(behavior change)* snowflake_warehouses datasource
- Added `like` field to enable warehouse filtering
- Added missing fields returned by SHOW WAREHOUSES and enclosed its output in `show_output` field.
- Added outputs from **DESC WAREHOUSE** and **SHOW PARAMETERS IN WAREHOUSE** (they can be turned off by declaring `with_describe = false` and `with_parameters = false`, **they're turned on by default**).
  The additional parameters call **DESC WAREHOUSE** (with `with_describe` turned on) and **SHOW PARAMETERS IN WAREHOUSE** (with `with_parameters` turned on) **per warehouse** returned by **SHOW WAREHOUSES**.
  The outputs of both commands are held in `warehouses` entry, where **DESC WAREHOUSE** is saved in the `describe_output` field, and **SHOW PARAMETERS IN WAREHOUSE** in the `parameters` field.
  It's important to limit the records and calls to Snowflake to the minimum. That's why we recommend assessing which information you need from the data source and then providing strong filters and turning off additional fields for better plan performance.

You can read more in ["raw Snowflake output"](./v1-preparations/CHANGES_BEFORE_V1.md#empty-values).

### *(new feature)* new database resources
As part of the [preparation for v1](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/ROADMAP.md#preparing-essential-ga-objects-for-the-provider-v1), we split up the database resource into multiple ones:
- Standard database - can be used as `snowflake_database` (replaces the old one and is used to create databases with optional ability to become a primary database ready for replication)
- Shared database - can be used as `snowflake_shared_database` (used to create databases from externally defined shares)
- Secondary database - can be used as `snowflake_secondary_database` (used to create replicas of databases from external sources)

All the field changes in comparison to the previous database resource are:
- `is_transient`
    - in `snowflake_shared_database`
        - removed: the field is removed from `snowflake_shared_database` as it doesn't have any effect on shared databases.
- `from_database` - database cloning was entirely removed and is not possible by any of the new database resources.
- `from_share` - the parameter was moved to the dedicated resource for databases created from shares `snowflake_shared_database`. Right now, it's a text field instead of a map. Additionally, instead of legacy account identifier format we're expecting the new one that with share looks like this: `<organization_name>.<account_name>.<share_name>`. For more information on account identifiers, visit the [official documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-account-identifier).
- `from_replication` - the parameter was moved to the dedicated resource for databases created from primary databases `snowflake_secondary_database`
- `replication_configuration` - renamed: was renamed to `configuration` and is only available in the `snowflake_database`. Its internal schema changed that instead of list of accounts, we expect a list of nested objects with accounts for which replication (and optionally failover) should be enabled. More information about converting between both versions [here](#resource-renamed-snowflake_database---snowflake_database_old). Additionally, instead of legacy account identifier format we're expecting the new one that looks like this: `<organization_name>.<account_name>` (it will be automatically migrated to the recommended format by the state upgrader). For more information on account identifiers, visit the [official documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-account-identifier).
- `data_retention_time_in_days`
  - in `snowflake_shared_database`
      - removed: the field is removed from `snowflake_shared_database` as it doesn't have any effect on shared databases.
  - in `snowflake_database` and `snowflake_secondary_database`
    - adjusted: now, it uses different approach that won't set it to -1 as a default value, but rather fills the field with the current value from Snowflake (this still can change).
- added: The following set of [parameters](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/parameters) was added to every database type:
    - `max_data_extension_time_in_days`
    - `external_volume`
    - `catalog`
    - `replace_invalid_characters`
    - `default_ddl_collation`
    - `storage_serialization_policy`
    - `log_level`
    - `trace_level`
    - `suspend_task_after_num_failures`
    - `task_auto_retry_attempts`
    - `user_task_managed_initial_warehouse_size`
    - `user_task_timeout_ms`
    - `user_task_minimum_trigger_interval_in_seconds`
    - `quoted_identifiers_ignore_case`
    - `enable_console_output`

The split was done (and will be done for several objects during the refactor) to simplify the resource on maintainability and usage level.
Its purpose was also to divide the resources by their specific purpose rather than cramping every use case of an object into one resource.

### *(behavior change)* Resource renamed snowflake_database -> snowflake_database_old
We made a decision to use the existing `snowflake_database` resource for redesigning it into a standard database.
The previous `snowflake_database` was renamed to `snowflake_database_old` and the current `snowflake_database`
contains completely new implementation that follows our guidelines we set for V1.
When upgrading to the 0.93.0 version, the automatic state upgrader should cover the migration for databases that didn't have the following fields set:
- `from_share` (now, the new `snowflake_shared_database` should be used instead)
- `from_replica` (now, the new `snowflake_secondary_database` should be used instead)
- `replication_configuration`

For configurations containing `replication_configuration` like this one:
```terraform
resource "snowflake_database" "test" {
  name = "<name>"
  replication_configuration {
    accounts = ["<account_locator>", "<account_locator_2>"]
    ignore_edition_check = true
  }
}
```

You have to transform the configuration into the following format (notice the change from account locator into the new account identifier format):
```terraform
resource "snowflake_database" "test" {
  name = "%s"
  replication {
    enable_to_account {
      account_identifier = "<organization_name>.<account_name>"
      with_failover      = false
    }
    enable_to_account {
      account_identifier = "<organization_name_2>.<account_name_2>"
      with_failover      = false
    }
  }
  ignore_edition_check = true
}
```

If you had `from_database` set, you should follow our [resource migration guide](./docs/guides/resource_migration.md) to remove
the database from state to later import it in the newer version of the provider.
Otherwise, it may cause issues when migrating to v0.93.0.
For now, we're dropping the possibility to create a clone database from other databases.
The only way will be to clone a database manually and import it as `snowflake_database`, but if
cloned databases diverge in behavior from standard databases, it may cause issues.

For databases with one of the fields mentioned above, manual migration will be needed.
Please refer to our [migration guide](./docs/guides/resource_migration.md) to perform zero downtime migration.

If you would like to upgrade to the latest version and postpone the upgrade, you still have to perform the manual migration
to the `snowflake_database_old` resource by following the [zero downtime migrations document](./docs/guides/resource_migration.md).
The only difference would be that instead of writing/generating new configurations you have to just rename the existing ones to contain `_old` suffix.

### *(behavior change)* snowflake_databases datasource
- `terse` and `history` fields were removed.
- `replication_configuration` field was removed from `databases`.
- `pattern` was replaced by `like` field.
- Additional filtering options added (`limit`).
- Added missing fields returned by SHOW DATABASES and enclosed its output in `show_output` field.
- Added outputs from **DESC DATABASE** and **SHOW PARAMETERS IN DATABASE** (they can be turned off by declaring `with_describe = false` and `with_parameters = false`, **they're turned on by default**).
The additional parameters call **DESC DATABASE** (with `with_describe` turned on) and **SHOW PARAMETERS IN DATABASE** (with `with_parameters` turned on) **per database** returned by **SHOW DATABASES**.
The outputs of both commands are held in `databases` entry, where **DESC DATABASE** is saved in the `describe_output` field, and **SHOW PARAMETERS IN DATABASE** in the `parameters` field.
It's important to limit the records and calls to Snowflake to the minimum. That's why we recommend assessing which information you need from the data source and then providing strong filters and turning off additional fields for better plan performance.

## v0.89.0 ➞ v0.90.0
### snowflake_table resource changes
#### *(behavior change)* Validation to column type added
While solving issue [#2733](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/2733) we have introduced diff suppression for `column.type`. To make it work correctly we have also added a validation to it. It should not cause any problems, but it's worth noting in case of any data types used that the provider is not aware of.

### snowflake_procedure resource changes
#### *(behavior change)* Validation to arguments type added
Diff suppression for `arguments.type` is needed for the same reason as above for `snowflake_table` resource.

### tag_masking_policy_association resource changes
Now the `tag_masking_policy_association` resource will only accept fully qualified names separated by dot `.` instead of pipe `|`.

Before
```terraform
resource "snowflake_tag_masking_policy_association" "name" {
    tag_id            = snowflake_tag.this.id
    masking_policy_id = snowflake_masking_policy.example_masking_policy.id
}
```

After
```terraform
resource "snowflake_tag_masking_policy_association" "name" {
    tag_id            = "\"${snowflake_tag.this.database}\".\"${snowflake_tag.this.schema}\".\"${snowflake_tag.this.name}\""
    masking_policy_id = "\"${snowflake_masking_policy.example_masking_policy.database}\".\"${snowflake_masking_policy.example_masking_policy.schema}\".\"${snowflake_masking_policy.example_masking_policy.name}\""
}
```

It's more verbose now, but after identifier rework it should be similar to the previous form.

## v0.88.0 ➞ v0.89.0
#### *(behavior change)* ForceNew removed
The `ForceNew` field was removed in favor of in-place Update for `name` parameter in:
- `snowflake_file_format`
- `snowflake_masking_policy`
So from now, these objects won't be re-created when the `name` changes, but instead only the name will be updated with `ALTER .. RENAME TO` statements.

## v0.87.0 ➞ v0.88.0

### snowflake_role data source deprecation

Already existing `snowflake_role` was deprecated in favor of the new `snowflake_roles`. You can have a similar behavior like before by specifying `pattern` field. Please adjust your Terraform configurations.

### snowflake_procedure resource changes
#### *(behavior change)* Execute as validation added
From now on, the `snowflake_procedure`'s `execute_as` parameter allows only two values: OWNER and CALLER (case-insensitive). Setting other values earlier resulted in falling back to the Snowflake default (currently OWNER) and creating a permadiff.

### snowflake_grants datasource changes
`snowflake_grants` datasource was refreshed as part of the ongoing [Grants Redesign](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/blob/main/ROADMAP.md#redesigning-grants).

#### *(behavior change)* role fields renames
To be aligned with the convention in other grant resources, `role` was renamed to `account_role` for the following fields:
- `grants_to.role`
- `grants_of.role`
- `future_grants_to.role`.

To migrate simply change `role` to `account_role` in the aforementioned fields.

#### *(behavior change)* grants_to.share type change
`grants_to.share` was a text field. Because Snowflake introduced new syntax `SHOW GRANTS TO SHARE <share_name> IN APPLICATION PACKAGE <app_package_name>` (check more in the [docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/show-grants#variants)) the type was changed to object. To migrate simply change:
```terraform
data "snowflake_grants" "example_to_share" {
  grants_to {
    share = "some_share"
  }
}
```
to
```terraform
data "snowflake_grants" "example_to_share" {
  grants_to {
    share {
      share_name = "some_share"
    }
  }
}
```
Note: `in_application_package` is not yet supported.

#### *(behavior change)* future_grants_in.schema type change
`future_grants_in.schema` was an object field allowing to set required `schema_name` and optional `database_name`. Our strategy is to be explicit, so the schema field was changed to string and fully qualified name is expected. To migrate change:
```terraform
data "snowflake_grants" "example_future_in_schema" {
  future_grants_in {
    schema {
      database_name = "some_database"
      schema_name   = "some_schema"
    }
  }
}
```
to
```terraform
data "snowflake_grants" "example_future_in_schema" {
  future_grants_in {
    schema = "\"some_database\".\"some_schema\""
  }
}
```
#### *(new feature)* grants_to new options
`grants_to` was enriched with three new options:
- `application`
- `application_role`
- `database_role`

No migration work is needed here.

#### *(new feature)* grants_of new options
`grants_to` was enriched with two new options:
- `database_role`
- `application_role`

No migration work is needed here.

#### *(new feature)* future_grants_to new options
`future_grants_to` was enriched with one new option:
- `database_role`

No migration work is needed here.

#### *(documentation)* improvements
Descriptions of attributes were altered. More examples were added (both for old and new features).

## v0.86.0 ➞ v0.87.0
### snowflake_database resource changes
#### *(behavior change)* External object identifier changes

Previously, in `snowflake_database` when creating a database form share, it was possible to provide `from_share.provider`
in the format of `<org_name>.<account_name>`. It worked even though we expected account locator because our "external" identifier wasn't quoting its string representation.
To be consistent with other identifier types, we quoted the output of "external" identifiers which makes such configurations break
(previously, they were working "by accident"). To fix it, the previous format of `<org_name>.<account_name>` has to be changed
to account locator format `<account_locator>` (mind that it's now case-sensitive). The account locator can be retrieved by calling `select current_account();` on the sharing account.
In the future we would like to eventually come back to the `<org_name>.<account_name>` format as it's recommended by Snowflake.

### Provider configuration changes

#### **IMPORTANT** *(bug fix)* Configuration hierarchy
There were several issues reported about the configuration hierarchy, e.g. [#2294](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/2294) and [#2242](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/2242).
In fact, the order of precedence described in the docs was not followed. This have led to the incorrect behavior.

After migrating to this version, the hierarchy from the docs should be followed:
```text
The Snowflake provider will use the following order of precedence when determining which credentials to use:
1) Provider Configuration
2) Environment Variables
3) Config File
```

**BEWARE**: your configurations will be affected with that change because they may have been leveraging the incorrect configurations precedence. Please be sure to check all the configurations before running terraform.

### snowflake_failover_group resource changes
#### *(bug fix)* ACCOUNT PARAMETERS is returned as PARAMETERS from SHOW FAILOVER GROUPS
Longer context in [#2517](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/2517).
After this change, one apply may be required to update the state correctly for failover group resources using `ACCOUNT PARAMETERS`.

### snowflake_database, snowflake_schema, and snowflake_table resource changes
#### *(behavior change)* Database `data_retention_time_in_days` + Schema `data_retention_days` + Table `data_retention_time_in_days`
For context [#2356](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/2356).
To make data retention fields truly optional (previously they were producing plan every time when no value was set),
we added `-1` as a possible value, and it is set as default. That got rid of the unexpected plans when no value is set and added possibility to use default value assigned by Snowflake (see [the data retention period](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-time-travel#data-retention-period)).

### snowflake_table resource changes
#### *(behavior change)* Table `data_retention_days` field removed in favor of `data_retention_time_in_days`
For context [#2356](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/2356).
To define data retention days for table `data_retention_time_in_days` should be used as deprecated `data_retention_days` field is being removed.

## v0.85.0 ➞ v0.86.0
### snowflake_table_constraint resource changes

#### *(behavior change)* NOT NULL removed from possible types
The `type` of the constraint was limited back to `UNIQUE`, `PRIMARY KEY`, and `FOREIGN KEY`.
The reason for that is, that syntax for Out-of-Line constraint ([docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-table-constraint#out-of-line-unique-primary-foreign-key)) does not contain `NOT NULL`.
It is noted as a behavior change but in some way it is not; with the previous implementation it did not work at all with `type` set to `NOT NULL` because the generated statement was not a valid Snowflake statement.

We will consider adding `NOT NULL` back because it can be set by `ALTER COLUMN columnX SET NOT NULL`, but first we want to revisit the whole resource design.

#### *(behavior change)* table_id reference
The docs were inconsistent. Example prior to 0.86.0 version showed using the `table.id` as the `table_id` reference. The description of the `table_id` parameter never allowed such a value (`table.id` is a `|`-delimited identifier representation and only the `.`-separated values were listed in the docs: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/snowflakedb/snowflake/0.85.0/docs/resources/table_constraint#required. The misuse of `table.id` parameter will result in error after migrating to 0.86.0. To make the config work, please remove and reimport the constraint resource from the state as described in [resource migration doc](./docs/guides/resource_migration.md).

After discussions in [#2535](https://github.com/snowflakedb/terraform-provider-snowflake/issues/2535) we decided to provide a temporary workaround in 0.87.0 version, so that the manual migration is not necessary. It allows skipping the migration and jumping straight to 0.87.0 version. However, the temporary workaround will be gone in one of the future versions. Please adjust to the newly suggested reference with the new resources you create.

### snowflake_external_function resource changes

#### *(behavior change)* return_null_allowed default is now true
The `return_null_allowed` attribute default value is now `true`. This is a behavior change because it was `false` before. The reason it was changed is to match the expected default value in the [documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-external-function#optional-parameters) `Default: The default is NULL (i.e. the function can return NULL values).`

#### *(behavior change)* comment is no longer required
The `comment` attribute is now optional. It was required before, but it is not required in Snowflake API.

### snowflake_external_functions data source changes

#### *(behavior change)* schema is now required with database
The `schema` attribute is now required with `database` attribute to match old implementation `SHOW EXTERNAL FUNCTIONS IN SCHEMA "<database>"."<schema>"`. In the future this may change to make schema optional.

## vX.XX.X ➞ v0.85.0
<a id="vxxxx---v0850"></a>

### Migration from old (grant) resources to new ones

In recent changes, we introduced a new grant resources to replace the old ones.
To aid with the migration, we wrote a guide to show one of the possible ways to migrate deprecated resources to their new counter-parts.
As the guide is more general and applies to every version (and provider), we moved it [here](./docs/guides/resource_migration.md).

### snowflake_procedure resource changes
#### *(deprecation)* return_behavior
`return_behavior` parameter is deprecated because it is also deprecated in the Snowflake API.

### snowflake_function resource changes
#### *(behavior change)* return_type
`return_type` has become force new because there is no way to alter it without dropping and recreating the function.

## v0.84.0 ➞ v0.85.0

### snowflake_stage resource changes

#### *(behavior change/regression)* copy_options
Setting `copy_options` to `ON_ERROR = 'CONTINUE'` would result in a permadiff. Use `ON_ERROR = CONTINUE` (without single quotes) or bump to v0.89.0 in which the behavior was fixed.

### snowflake_notification_integration resource changes
#### *(behavior change)* notification_provider
`notification_provider` becomes required and has three possible values `AZURE_STORAGE_QUEUE`, `AWS_SNS`, and `GCP_PUBSUB`.
It is still possible to set it to `AWS_SQS` but because there is no underlying SQL, so it will result in an error.
Attributes `aws_sqs_arn` and `aws_sqs_role_arn` will be ignored.
Computed attributes `aws_sqs_external_id` and `aws_sqs_iam_user_arn` won't be updated.

#### *(behavior change)* force new for multiple attributes
Force new was added for the following attributes (because no usable SQL alter statements for them):
- `azure_storage_queue_primary_uri`
- `azure_tenant_id`
- `gcp_pubsub_subscription_name`
- `gcp_pubsub_topic_name`

#### *(deprecation)* direction
`direction` parameter is deprecated because it is added automatically on the SDK level.

#### *(deprecation)* type
`type` parameter is deprecated because it is added automatically on the SDK level (and basically it's always `QUEUE`).

## v0.73.0 ➞ v0.74.0
### Provider configuration changes

In this change we have done a provider refactor to make it more complete and customizable by supporting more options that
were already available in Golang Snowflake driver. This lead to several attributes being added and a few deprecated.
We will focus on the deprecated ones and show you how to adapt your current configuration to the new changes.

#### *(rename)* username ➞ user
Provider field `username` were renamed to `user`. Adjust your provider configuration like below:
```terraform
provider "snowflake" {
  # before
  username = "username"

  # after
  user = "username"
}
```

#### *(structural change)* OAuth API
Provider fields regarding Oauth were renamed and nested. Adjust your provider configuration like below:

```terraform
provider "snowflake" {
  # before
  browser_auth        = false
  oauth_access_token  = "<access_token>"
  oauth_refresh_token = "<refresh_token>"
  oauth_client_id     = "<client_id>"
  oauth_client_secret = "<client_secret>"
  oauth_endpoint      = "<endpoint>"
  oauth_redirect_url  = "<redirect_uri>"

  # after
  authenticator = "ExternalBrowser"
  token         = "<access_token>"
  token_accessor {
    refresh_token   = "<refresh_token>"
    client_id       = "<client_id>"
    client_secret   = "<client_secret>"
    token_endpoint  = "<endpoint>"
    redirect_uri    = "<redirect_uri>"
  }
}
```

#### *(remove redundant information)* region

Specifying a region is a legacy thing and according to https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-account-identifier
you can specify a region as a part of account parameter. Specifying account parameter with the region is also considered legacy,
but with this approach it will be easier to convert only your account identifier to the new preferred way of specifying account identifier.

```terraform
provider "snowflake" {
  # before
  region = "<cloud_region_id>"

  # after
  account = "<account_locator>.<cloud_region_id>"
}
```

#### private_key_path deprecation
Provider field `private_key_path` is now deprecated in favor of `private_key` and `file` Terraform function (see [docs](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/functions/file)). Adjust your provider configuration like below:

```terraform
provider "snowflake" {
  # before
  private_key_path = "<filepath>"

  # after
  private_key = file("<filepath>")
}
```

#### *(rename)* session_params ➞ params
Provider field `session_params` were renamed to `params`. Adjust your provider configuration like below:
```terraform
provider "snowflake" {
  # before
  session_params = {}

  # after
  params = {}
}
```

#### *(behavior change)* authenticator (JWT)

Before the change `authenticator` parameter did not have to be set for private key authentication and was deduced by the provider. The change is a result of the introduced configuration alignment with an underlying [gosnowflake driver](https://github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake). The authentication type is required there, and it defaults to user+password one. From this version, set `authenticator` to `JWT` explicitly.
