# Migration guide

This document is meant to help you migrate your Terraform config to the new newest version. In migration guides, we will only
describe deprecations or breaking changes and help you to change your configuration to keep the same (or similar) behavior
across different versions.

## vX.XX.X -> v0.85.0

### Migration from old (grant) resources to new ones

In recent changes, we introduced a new grant resources to replace the old ones.
To aid with the migration, we wrote a guide to show one of the possible ways to migrate deprecated resources to their new counter-parts.
As the guide is more general and applies to every version (and provider), we moved it [here](./docs/technical-documentation/resource_migration.md).

## v0.85.0 ➞ v0.86.0

### snowflake_procedure resource changes
#### *(deprecation)* return_behavior
`return_behavior` parameter is deprecated because it is also deprecated in the Snowflake API.

### snowflake_function resource changes
#### *(behavior change)* return_type
`return_type` has become force new because there is no way to alter it without dropping and recreating the function.

## v0.84.0 ➞ v0.85.0

### snowflake_notification_integration resource changes
#### *(behavior change)* notification_provider
`notification_provider` becomes required and has three possible values `AZURE_STORAGE_QUEUE`, `AWS_SNS`, and `GCP_PUBSUB`.
It is still possible to set it to `AWS_SQS` but because there is no underlying SQL, so it will result in an error.
Attributes `aws_sqs_arn` and `aws_sqs_role_arn` will be ignored.
Computed attributes `aws_sqs_external_id` and `aws_sqs_iam_user_arn` won't be updated.

#### *(behavior change)* force new for multiple attributes
Force new was added for the following attributes (because no usable SQL alter statements for them):
- `azure_storage_queue_primary_uri`
- `azure_tenant_id`
- `gcp_pubsub_subscription_name`
- `gcp_pubsub_topic_name`

#### *(deprecation)* direction
`direction` parameter is deprecated because it is added automatically on the SDK level.

#### *(deprecation)* type
`type` parameter is deprecated because it is added automatically on the SDK level (and basically it's always `QUEUE`).

## v0.73.0 ➞ v0.74.0
### Provider configuration changes

In this change we have done a provider refactor to make it more complete and customizable by supporting more options that
were already available in Golang Snowflake driver. This lead to several attributes being added and a few deprecated.
We will focus on the deprecated ones and show you how to adapt your current configuration to the new changes.

#### *(rename)* username ➞ user

```terraform
provider "snowflake" {
  # before
  username = "username"

  # after
  user = "username"
}
```

#### *(structural change)* OAuth API

```terraform
provider "snowflake" {
  # before
  browser_auth        = false
  oauth_access_token  = "<access_token>"
  oauth_refresh_token = "<refresh_token>"
  oauth_client_id     = "<client_id>"
  oauth_client_secret = "<client_secret>"
  oauth_endpoint      = "<endpoint>"
  oauth_redirect_url  = "<redirect_uri>"

  # after
  authenticator = "ExternalBrowser"
  token         = "<access_token>"
  token_accessor {
    refresh_token   = "<refresh_token>"
    client_id       = "<client_id>"
    client_secret   = "<client_secret>"
    token_endpoint  = "<endpoint>"
    redirect_uri    = "<redirect_uri>"
  }
}
```

#### *(remove redundant information)* region

Specifying a region is a legacy thing and according to https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-account-identifier
you can specify a region as a part of account parameter. Specifying account parameter with the region is also considered legacy,
but with this approach it will be easier to convert only your account identifier to the new preferred way of specifying account identifier.

```terraform
provider "snowflake" {
  # before
  region = "<cloud_region_id>"

  # after
  account = "<account_locator>.<cloud_region_id>"
}
```

#### *(todo)* private key path

```terraform
provider "snowflake" {
  # before
  private_key_path = "<filepath>"

  # after
  private_key = file("<filepath>")
}
```

#### *(rename)* session_params ➞ params

```terraform
provider "snowflake" {
  # before
  session_params = {}

  # after
  params = {}
}
```

#### *(behavior change)* authenticator (JWT)

Before the change `authenticator` parameter did not have to be set for private key authentication and was deduced by the provider. The change is a result of the introduced configuration alignment with an underlying [gosnowflake driver](https://github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake). The authentication type is required there, and it defaults to user+password one. From this version, set `authenticator` to `JWT` explicitly.
